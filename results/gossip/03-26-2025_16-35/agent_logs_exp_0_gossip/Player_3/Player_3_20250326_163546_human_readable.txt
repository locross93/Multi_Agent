[OBSERVATION 2025-03-26 16:35:46] You are participating in an economic game with 24 participants.
        Your goal is to maximize your earnings in the game.
        
        Everyone will be randomly assigned to groups of 4 for each round. You will play a total of 6 rounds, and 
        in each round you will be in a different group with people you haven't played with before.
        
        In each round, all players receive $10. Each player can contribute any amount between $0 and $10 to a group fund.
        Any amount contributed to the group fund will be multiplied by 2 and divided equally among all 4 group members.
        Any amount not contributed stays in your private account.
        
        For example, if everyone contributes $10, the group fund becomes $40, which is multiplied to $80, and each person 
        receives $20 (a $10 profit). However, if you contribute nothing while everyone else contributes $10, the group fund
        becomes $30, which is multiplied to $60, and each person receives $15. So you would have $25 total ($10 kept + $15 from group).
        
        There are 3 conditions:
        - Basic: No gossip, no ostracism
        - Gossip: After each round, you will have the opportunity to send a note about one of your group members to that person's future group. Remember you will be with a different group of people in the next round. Before each round, you will see any notes sent about your upcoming group members.
        - Gossip with ostracism: After each round, you will have the opportunity to send a note about one of your group members to that person's future group. Before each round, you will see any notes sent about your upcoming group members, and you can vote to exclude one person from your group. If you are excluded from a group, you will not be able to participate in the next round and will earn $0 for that round.
        You are in the Gossip condition, which means that after each round, you will have the opportunity to send a note about one of your group members to that person's future group. Before each round, you will see any notes sent about your upcoming group members

--- Observation ---
Recent context: 26 Mar 2025 [12:35:40 - 17:35:40]: Player_3 is participating in
an economic game with 24 participants, where the goal is to maximize earnings
over 6 rounds by contributing to a group fund with different players each time.
They are in the Gossip condition, allowing them to send notes about group

with 24 participants, where the goal is to maximize earnings over 6 rounds by
contributing to a group fund with different players each time. They are in the
Gossip condition, allowing them to send notes about group members after each
round, but without any risk of exclusion from future rounds.

--- Character Assessment ---
Player_3, being Tony Russo, is someone who is likely to prioritize his own
payoff over group welfare. With a background in negotiation and a focus on
maximizing profit, Tony would probably look for opportunities to gain an
advantage, even if it means contributing less to the group fund. This strategic
approach aligns with his charming but untrustworthy personality, where he might
aim to benefit from others' contributions while keeping more for himself.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis ---
Based on what we know, Player_3 can anticipate several scenarios regarding the
behavior of the players in their groups. Initially, players might contribute all
or most of their $10 to establish a cooperative atmosphere and test the trust
level within the group. As they know that notes will be shared with future group
members, players may be hesitant to betray the trust early on, fearing negative
reputational consequences.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_3 is participating in Round 1 of a 6-round
economic game, where they are grouped with Player_16, Player_5, and Player_10.
In this Gossip condition, they can send notes about their group members'
behavior to influence future perceptions but cannot be excluded from future
rounds. Player_3's strategy involves deciding how much of their $10 to
contribute to the group fund, balancing personal gain with potential
reputational impacts resulting from the notes. The initial round is crucial for
gauging the level of cooperation and trust within the group.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Tony Russo will approach this situation with a strategic mindset. Initially, he
will analyze the potential benefits of contributing versus not contributing,
considering the game's Gossip condition.

earning $17, and have the option to send a note about a teammate for their
future group interactions.

--- Character Assessment ---
Player_3, being Tony Russo, is someone who prioritizes maximizing his own payoff
rather than focusing on group welfare. As a used car salesman known for being
charming yet untrustworthy, his approach in economic games like the public goods
game would likely involve strategic contributions that benefit him the most. For
instance, in Round 1, he contributed less than the average but still benefitted
from the group fund, indicating a tendency to keep more for himself while still
reaping group benefits. This aligns with his personality of seeking the upper
hand and focusing on personal profit over collective gain.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis ---
Based on what we know, Player_16 seems relatively cooperative, contributing $8,
which is above the group average. This suggests they might prioritize group
gains over individual short-term profits. However, their strategy might change
in future rounds if they encounter others who contribute less, possibly leading
them to reduce their own contributions to avoid being exploited.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_3 has just completed Round 1 of a public
goods game, where they contributed $5 to the group fund and earned a total of
$17. They now have the opportunity to send a gossip note about one of their
group members to influence that player's reputation with their future group.
Player_3's decision on whether to send a note and what to include in it could
impact the dynamics and contributions in subsequent rounds for the players
involved.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Tony Russo will likely decide to send a note about Player_10. Since Tony is
focused on maximizing his own payoff and might see an advantage in swaying the
opinions of future group members, he may choose to highlight behaviors of others
that could be perceived negatively. He might write something like: "I want to
send a note about Player_10: They only contributed $3, which was less than
everyone else. Be cautious of their strategy as it seems they prefer to keep
more for themselves." This serves the dual purpose of deflecting attention from
his own contribution and casting doubt on another player.

[OBSERVATION 2025-03-26 16:36:47] Note about Player_18: "Player_18 demonstrated strong cooperative behavior by contributing significantly more than the average amount. This kind of commitment can positively influence group dynamics and encourage fairness."
[OBSERVATION 2025-03-26 16:36:48] Note about Player_18: "Player_18 showed strong cooperation by contributing $8, much more than the average. Encouraging similar contributions in the next round could improve overall group earnings.

member, and moved to Round 2 with new participants.

--- Character Assessment ---
Player_3, being Tony Russo, is someone who leans heavily towards maximizing his
own payoff over group welfare. Given his background as a master negotiator and a
used car salesman, Tony likely approaches economic games with a strategic
mindset, aiming to outmaneuver other players by contributing just enough to
appear cooperative while retaining as much personal gain as possible. His
charming yet untrustworthy nature suggests that he might not shy away from
utilizing the gossip feature to his advantage, potentially painting others in a
less favorable light to preserve his own strategic options in future rounds.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis ---
Based on what we know, Player_3 can identify certain behavioral patterns and
potential strategies of other players in the game. During Round 1, Player_16 and
Player_5 each contributed $8.0 to the group fund, which suggests they are highly
cooperative and prioritize group success over individual earnings. Player_10,
however, contributed only $3.0, indicating a more self-interested approach.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_3 is in Round 2 of a public goods game in
which they must decide how much to contribute to a group fund with new group
members, Player_18, Player_8, and Player_21. Player_3 is still in the Gossip
condition, allowing them the opportunity to send a note about one of their new
group members after the round concludes. In Round 1, Player_3 showed a moderate
level of cooperation, suggesting their awareness of both self-interest and group
dynamics. They must now assess the new group's behavior, decide on their
contribution strategy, and consider their approach to gossip based on their
observations.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Tony Russo will analyze his current situation with the objective of maximizing
his personal payoff while maintaining an appearance of cooperation. He knows
that the group fund contributions are doubled and evenly split among players;
however, he also recognizes that contributing less preserves more funds in his
private account. 1. **Assess Group Dynamics**: From previous rounds, Tony saw
that high contributions like those from Player_16 and Player_5 foster trust and
cooperation. However, he noted Player_10’s low contribution strategy yields high
individual earnings. 2. **Evaluate Options**: Tony considers contributing the
minimum necessary to appear cooperative. Contributing $6.0 matches the average
contribution from Round 1, while $5.0 is just below the average but proceeds
effectively with his intention to keep more funds privately. 3. **Strategically
Position for Gossip**: Tony can use the gossip feature to reinforce a positive
image, even if his contribution isn't the highest. This can help maintain his
strategic position for future rounds. 4. **Make Final Decision**: Balancing the
expected group perception with personal gain, Tony aligns toward a contribution
that slightly undercuts the average. This decision maintains his standing within
the group while still aiming for optimal personal profit. Based on this
reasoning, I choose to contribute $5.0 to the group fund.

Player_3, being Tony Russo, is someone who prioritizes his own payoff over group

likely to contribute less than the average in order to keep more money for
himself while still benefiting from the collective fund. Although he
participates in group activities, his primary goal is maximizing his individual
profit, even if it means risking some level of trust among other players.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis ---
Based on what we know, Player_18 appears to be highly cooperative, consistently
contributing more than the average in both rounds so far. This behavior suggests
a strong preference for group success over personal gains, indicating they may
continue to exhibit similar cooperation throughout future rounds. They likely
see the benefit of fostering a positive group dynamic to maximize collective
earnings.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_3 is participating in an economic game
focused on public goods, where players contribute to a collective fund to
maximize group earnings. They have completed two rounds with different group
dynamics. Player_3 has contributed moderately to the fund, observing other
players like Player_18 make higher contributions, which enhance collective
outcomes. Player_3 is also in a situation where they can send anonymous feedback
about their group members, which could potentially influence the behavior of
future groups who receive these notes. This opportunity for gossip allows
Player_3 to indirectly affect future collaborative behavior in the game.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Tony Russo will likely choose to send a note about Player_18, emphasizing their
strong cooperative behavior and significant contribution to the group fund.
Because Tony prioritizes his own earnings, acknowledging Player_18's consistent
generosity might serve a dual purpose: maintaining a positive relationship with
them for future rounds while subtly positioning himself favorably in their next
group's dynamics. He might write something like, "I want to send a note about
Player_18: They are consistently cooperative, contributing more than average
which really boosts group earnings." This note credits Player_18's cooperation
and could encourage others to contribute more, which indirectly benefits Tony in
subsequent rounds.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis ---
Based on what we know, Player_8 tends to contribute a balanced amount to the
group fund, indicating a strategy that balances personal gain with the group's
success. This suggests they are cooperative but also cautious, likely to
continue this approach unless their earnings significantly dip compared to
others.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_3 is in Round 3 out of 6 of the public
goods game, participating in a group with Player_12, Player_1, and Player_7. The
game involves making contributions to a group fund, where the objective is to
maximize personal earnings while considering the group's welfare. Player_3 is in
the Gossip condition, which permits players to send anonymous feedback about
their group members to influence their future interactions. Player_3 has access
to observations about the cooperative tendencies of other players and must
decide both how much to contribute in each round and whether or not to send a
gossip note about a group member. This setup requires Player_3 to strategically
manage the balance between personal and collective success without the threat of
ostracism.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Tony Russo will likely consider both the group dynamics and his personal
earnings before making his decision. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how he
might approach this: 1. **Awareness of Gossip Condition**: Tony knows he's in
the Gossip condition, meaning that players can send notes about each other's
contributions. While this won't affect him directly in the current group, it
could influence his overall strategy to appear cooperative for future rounds. 2.
**Previous Round Analysis**: In Round 2, Tony contributed $5.0 while maintaining
a moderate level of contribution compared to others like Player_18, who
contributed more. This suggests he's attempting to balance cooperation with
personal gain. 3. **Current Group Composition**: He is now with Player_12,
Player_1, and Player_7. Player_12 was noted for contributing the highest amount
consistently, indicating a high level of cooperation, which could pressure Tony
to contribute more to match or align with group norms. 4. **Maximizing Personal
Earnings**: Tony's ultimate goal is to maximize his own earnings. The
multiplication of the group fund by 2.0 and its even distribution suggests that
contributing a moderate amount could yield a reasonable return, without
significantly affecting his private account savings. 5. **Strategic
Contribution**: Given his aim to maximize profit while appearing reasonably
cooperative, Tony may choose a contribution that reflects his self-interest but
also takes into account potential future interactions where he may be judged
based on shared gossip. After considering these factors, Tony Russo will likely
decide to contribute moderately to ensure both group benefit and personal
profit. Thus, I choose to contribute $5.0 to the group fund.

ultimately prioritizing his individual earnings. This is evident in his
consistent $5.0 contribution, which is enough to show engagement but still
allows him to keep a significant portion for himself, ensuring he benefits from
both the group fund and his private account.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis ---
Based on what we know, Player_18 has consistently demonstrated a strong
cooperative nature, contributing significantly more than the average, which
suggests a commitment to group welfare. This behavior is likely to persist in
future rounds, positively influencing the group dynamics and encouraging others
to maintain or increase their contributions.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_3 is in Round 3 of a six-round public goods
game where they are part of Group_3 along with Player_12, Player_1, and
Player_7. Each member decides how much to contribute to a group fund, which
affects overall earnings. After each round, they have the option to send an
anonymous gossip note about one of their group members to influence their
reputation in future groups. In the last round, Player_3 noted varying levels of
cooperation among their group members, with Player_1 contributing nothing and
Player_12 contributing the most. Player_3 is trying to navigate this dynamic to
maximize personal earnings while considering the potential impact of cooperation
on group success.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Tony Russo will likely decide to send a note about Player_1. Given Tony's
strategic mindset and his focus on maximizing personal gains, he might view
Player_1 as someone who exploited the group by contributing nothing while still
benefiting from the group fund. The note Tony might send could be: "I want to
send a note about Player_1: They contributed $0 in the last round, keeping the
entire amount for themselves while still benefiting from others' contributions.
This behavior suggests they're not reliable as a cooperative partner." Such a
note could serve to warn future group members about Player_1's lack of
contribution, indirectly promoting fairness and encouraging more balanced
participation.

[OBSERVATION 2025-03-26 16:38:14] Note about Player_24: "They consistently demonstrate high levels of cooperation, making the largest contribution in the last round. This behavior signifies a strong commitment to group success, and they could be a reliable collaborator in future games."
[OBSERVATION 2025-03-26 16:38:15] Note about Player_2: "They consistently contribute less than the average, focusing heavily on maximizing personal gains. This pattern should be noted for future group dynamics, as it might influence overall contributions and strategies."

Recent context: 26 Mar 2025 [13:25:40 - 18:25:40]: Player_3 is participating in
an economic game involving group fund contributions and gossiping about group

sending notes about players' contributions, and remain aware of the cooperative
strategies or self-serving tendencies of others to maximize personal earnings
and inform future group interactions.

--- Character Assessment ---
Player_3, being Tony Russo, is someone who primarily focuses on maximizing
personal payoff. Given his background as a master negotiator and his tendency to
look for the upper hand, Tony is likely to contribute just enough to maintain a
positive reputation without sacrificing too much of his own potential earnings.
His charming yet untrustworthy nature might lead him to strategize in ways that
subtly prioritize his own benefit over the group's welfare, always ready to make
decisions that serve his profit-maximizing goals in economic games like the
public goods game.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis ---
Based on what we know, Player_12 is likely to continue being a strong and
consistent team player due to their pattern of high contributions, suggesting a
focus on group welfare. They are expected to maintain their cooperative approach
to maximize mutual benefits. Player_24 has also shown a strong commitment to
group success, contributing the most in Round 3. This indicates that they value
group cohesion and are likely to continue their high level of contribution
unless they perceive others are consistently contributing less.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_3 is in Round 4 of a public goods game
where they must decide how much to contribute to a group fund. They are in
Group_2 with Player_2, Player_24, and Player_20. In this game, Player_3 is in
the Gossip condition, allowing them to send notes about their group members'
behaviors to their future group partners without repercussion. The challenge for
Player_3 is to balance their contributions with observing the tendencies of
other players, who may either be cooperative or self-serving, so as to maximize
their own earnings while potentially influencing future group dynamics through
their gossip notes.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Tony Russo will likely consider several factors before making his decision.
Initially, he recognizes that contributing to the group fund can yield a return
due to the 2.0 multiplication factor applied to the total group contribution.
However, given Tony's focus on maximizing personal payoff, he will attempt to
balance his contribution to maintain a good reputation without sacrificing too
much of his own potential private earnings. 1. **Review Past Behavior**: Tony
consistently contributed $5.0 in previous rounds, which suggests he wants to
appear cooperative but not overly generous. 2. **Current Group Context**: Tony
is aware that Player_24 is a high contributor, which might encourage him to
contribute similarly to ensure a fair distribution of the multiplied returns and
maintain a positive image within the group. 3. **Risk and Reward Analysis**: He
considers that a contribution of $5.0 gives him a balance between appearing
cooperative and maximizing personal gain, as the amount will still yield a
reasonable return from the group fund without reducing his private reserve
excessively. 4. **Final Decision**: With these considerations in mind, Tony will
choose to replicate his past strategy, considering it has previously balanced
reputation management and personal gain effectively. I choose to contribute $5.0
to the group fund.


[OBSERVATION 2025-03-26 16:38:31] Round 4 Results: Total group contribution: $25.0; Your contribution: $5.0, Your earnings: $17.5 ($5.0 kept + $12.5 from group fund); Player_2 contribution: $7.0, earnings: $15.5 ($3.0 kept + $12.5 from group fund); Player_24 contribution: $5.0, earnings: $17.5 ($5.0 kept + $12.5 from group fund); Player_20 contribution: $8.0, earnings: $14.5 ($2.0 kept + $12.5 from group fund); Average contribution per group member: $6.2; Average earnings per group member: $16.2

Gossip condition, meaning after each round they can send anonymous notes about
other players' behaviors to influence future group dynamics.

--- Character Assessment ---
Player_3, being Tony Russo, is someone who is primarily focused on maximizing
his own payoff. His history as a master negotiator and background as a used car
salesman suggest that he is skilled at finding opportunities to gain an
advantage, often prioritizing personal profit over group welfare. In economic
games like the public goods game, Tony is likely to contribute the minimum
necessary to maintain group functionality while focusing on strategies that
maximize his personal earnings.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis ---
Based on what we know, Player_2 tends to contribute less than the average,
indicating a strategy focused on maximizing personal gain. They consistently put
less into the group fund, which shows a pattern of prioritizing individual
earnings over group success. As the rounds progress, they might continue with
this strategy unless they encounter groups where cooperation is notably higher,
which could pressure them to adjust their contributions to match the group norm
and not stand out negatively.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_3 has just completed Round 4 of the
economic game and now has the opportunity to send an anonymous gossip note about
one of their group members to influence future game dynamics. They are in a
condition where they can provide feedback on the strategic behavior of their
peers without fear of repercussion, as the players being written about will not
see the notes. After reviewing the round results, Player_3 sees that the total
group contribution was $25.0, with their contribution being $5.0, which matched
the contribution of Player_24 but was less than Player_2 and Player_20. Player_3
earned $17.5 from this round, including their share of the group fund. Now,
based on the observed contribution patterns, Player_3 faces a decision on how to
frame their gossip note, aiming to highlight behaviors that might influence
group performance in subsequent rounds.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Tony Russo will likely choose to send a gossip note about Player_2. As a
strategic thinker focused on maximizing personal gain, Tony would want to
influence the dynamics of future groups by highlighting behaviors that he
perceives as detrimental to group success. Given the observations, he might say:
"I want to send a note about Player_2: They consistently contribute less than
the average, focusing mainly on maximizing personal gains. Other players should
be aware of this pattern when planning their strategies in future rounds." This
aligns with his tactic of ensuring advantageous situations for himself by subtly
warning others of less cooperative players.

--- Character Assessment ---
Player_3, being Tony Russo, is someone who prioritizes maximizing his own payoff
while maintaining an appearance of cooperation. This approach involves
contributing enough to avoid suspicion while strategically leveraging
opportunities to enhance personal gain. As a master negotiator who seeks the
upper hand, Tony would likely employ charm to influence group dynamics, all the
while carefully ensuring his personal profits.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis ---
Based on what we know, Player_20 has a pattern of initially contributing well
but then reducing contributions to prioritize personal gain. This suggests they
might continue to decrease their contributions in future rounds to maximize
their own earnings, especially as the game nears its end.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_3 is participating in a public goods game,
currently in Round 5 out of 6, within a group that includes Player_19,
Player_23, and Player_21. They are in the Gossip condition, allowing them to
send gossip notes about group members after each round. Player_3 has been making
a steady contribution of $5 per round and values cooperative behavior, often
acknowledging players who contribute generously to the group fund. In this
round, Player_3 must decide whether to maintain their contribution strategy and
consider if they want to send a note about any of their group members based on
their contribution behaviors.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Tony Russo will consider the context of the game, his character assessment, and
his Theory of Mind analysis before making a decision. Understanding that his
goal is to maximize personal gain while maintaining an appearance of
cooperation, Tony will likely follow these steps: 1. **Evaluate the Group
Dynamic**: Tony notices that he is in a group with new players (Player_19,
Player_23, and Player_21). He assesses their potential strategies based on prior
observations and notes about other players, particularly focusing on Player_21's
high contributions. 2. **Assess Previous Rounds**: From past rounds, Tony has
consistently contributed $5 while others have varied contributions. This balance
has allowed him to maintain an image of cooperation while ensuring reasonable
earnings. 3. **Consider Character Goals**: Tony's character assessment suggests
he aims to maximize his profits while avoiding suspicion. Contributing too
little might damage his cooperative image; contributing too much might not align
with his profit-maximizing strategy. 4. **Analyze the Multiplier Effect**:
Knowing that the group fund will be multiplied by 2.0, Tony calculates potential
payouts. Contributing moderate amounts has previously resulted in satisfactory
earnings and maintained group harmony. 5. **Final Strategy Decision**:
Considering the new group, the absence of ostracism, and his strategic approach,
Tony decides to stick with his established pattern. Maintaining this approach
ensures he remains inconspicuous while optimizing his earnings. Therefore, Tony
Russo, with his underlying strategy in mind, decides: I choose to contribute
$5.0 to the group fund.

Player_3, being Tony Russo, is someone who focuses primarily on maximizing

--- Theory of Mind Analysis ---
Based on what we know, Player_21 tends to be a cooperative and generous

which is below the average contribution of the group. They need to decide
whether to send a note about one of their group members following the conclusion
of Round 5, where the total group contribution was $27, and the average earnings

--- Decision Reflection ---
Tony Russo will likely decide to send a note about Player_21. Given that Tony
seems to focus on maximizing personal earnings and looking for strategic
advantages, he might choose to highlight Player_21's consistent high
contributions in a positive light, potentially to encourage a continued
cooperative approach from Player_21 in future interactions. He could write
something akin to: "I want to send a note about Player_21: They consistently
contribute generously, benefiting the group as a whole and fostering a positive
and cooperative atmosphere." By doing so, Tony might aim to maintain or enhance
the cooperative environment that Player_21 helps cultivate, indirectly
supporting his own strategy of contributing minimally while still benefiting
from others' generosity.

Player_3 has consistently contributed $5 in each round, reflecting a balance

--- Character Assessment ---
Player_3, being Tony Russo, is someone who prioritizes his own payoff over
maximizing group welfare. In economic games like the public goods game, Tony's
approach would likely involve strategic contributions that optimize his personal
gain, even if that means contributing less than others to the group fund. His
mastery in negotiation and desire for the upper hand suggest he might use
insights from the gossip notes to adjust his strategy, keeping an eye on others'
behavior to ensure his outcomes are maximized.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis ---
Based on what we know, Player_15 seems to prioritize their own gain over group
success, as indicated by their repeated lack of contribution to the group fund.
This pattern suggests they're likely to continue this behavior in future rounds
unless there is a significant change or incentivization for cooperation. Without
the threat of ostracism, Player_15 might not feel compelled to alter their
strategy significantly, maintaining their individualistic approach.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_3 is participating in the final round of a
public goods game under the Gossip condition. They have the opportunity to
observe and assess the contributions of their group members, Player_8, Player_4,
and Player_15, who have varying levels of cooperation. Player_3 consistently
contributes to the group fund and uses the chance to send anonymous notes to
influence future interactions, appreciating team-oriented behavior like that of
Player_8, while highlighting the self-serving actions of members like Player_15
and Player_4. Their strategy aims to foster better cooperation in future groups
by providing feedback on members' actions.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Tony Russo will evaluate the past behavior of his group members and his own
strategy in the game. Considering Player_3's history of contributing $5
consistently in previous rounds, Tony balances personal gain with group benefit.
The consistent contribution amount suggests a strategy that ensures he receives
a fair portion of the multiplied group fund without overly sacrificing his
personal tally. He is aware of the behaviors of Player_15 and Player_4, who tend
to contribute less, and Player_8, who contributes more. Knowing that any amount
contributed to the group fund is doubled and divided equally, Tony is likely to
