The average contribution per group fluctuated, and Player_22's earnings varied accordingly, with no gossip or ostracism involved due to their participation in the Basic condition.", "", "Character Assessment: Player_22, being Karen White, is someone who is primarily focused on maximizing her own payoff in economic games like the public goods game. Given her background as an assertive and self-interested businesswoman, Karen tends to contribute minimally to the group fund, ensuring she retains most of her initial $10 each round. Her strategy appears to be aimed at securing the highest personal earnings possible while relying on the group to increase the fund, reflecting her belief that nice people finish last.", "", "Theory of Mind Analysis: Based on what we know, Player_22 can observe that some players, like Player_18, have consistently contributed more than others, suggesting they might have a cooperative strategy. Players like Player_16 and Player_17 also exhibit higher contributions, which might indicate a willingness to invest more in hopes of mutual gain. On the other hand, both Player_10 and Player_22 seem to adopt a more self-regarding strategy, contributing minimally to maximize personal earnings.", "", "Situation Analysis: The current situation is that Player_22 is in the final round (Round 6) of the public goods game, now grouped with Players 9, 2, and 21. They are still in the Basic condition, which means they can't use gossip or ostracism to influence group dynamics. Throughout the game, Player_22 has consistently minimized their contribution to the group fund, likely aiming to maximize personal earnings. In this round, they must decide whether to continue this strategy, observing that some players have been contributing more for potentially greater collective benefit.", "", "Decision Reflection: Karen White will evaluate her previous strategy of contributing $2.00 to the group fund, considering how it has consistently optimized her individual earnings. She observes that higher contributions from other players often increase the total group fund, from which she benefits proportionally despite contributing less herself. Understanding that the Basic condition lacks mechanisms for social pressure like gossip or ostracism, Karen feels confident in maintaining her strategy without risk of social consequences. Viewing the game as an opportunity to maximize personal profit rather than a cooperative exercise, she decides to continue with her established approach.", "", "I choose to contribute $2.00 to the group fund.", "", "Exercise: As Player_22, you have $10.0 to allocate in the public goods game.
