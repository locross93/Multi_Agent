Across the rounds, they earned varying amounts based on the group's total contributions, with their earnings generally ranging from $13.5 to $16.0 per round.", "", "Character Assessment: Player_15, being Sophie Lambert, is someone who approaches economic games with a focus on fairness and strategic thinking. With her professional background as a defense attorney and a belief in fair treatment, she tends to find a balance between maximizing her own payoff and contributing to group welfare. Her consistent $5.0 contribution in each round suggests she aims to maintain a reasonable personal gain while promoting cooperative behavior within the group. She likely values strategic consistency and fairness in these scenarios.", "", "Theory of Mind Analysis: Based on what we know, the participants in this public goods game generally contribute modest amounts, with variations in contributions influencing overall earnings. Since there's no gossip or ostracism, players might feel freer to prioritize individual profit over group benefit without fear of social repercussions. Some players, like Player_21, seem willing to contribute slightly more in hopes of boosting group earnings, while others maintain a steady contribution, indicating a more consistent or risk-averse strategy. As the rounds progress, players might start optimizing for personal gain if they realize that raising contributions doesn't significantly increase personal or group earnings due to the lack of social pressure. Hence, strategies are likely to remain consistent, with minor adjustments based on observed behaviors of the group.", "", "Situation Analysis: The current situation is that Player_15 is in the final round of the public goods game, participating in Group_1 with Player_13, Player_24, and Player_11. Player_15 has consistently contributed $5.0 in previous rounds, following a steady and risk-averse strategy. With the game being in the Basic condition, there is no mechanism for gossip or ostracism, meaning Player_15 does not have to worry about social consequences for their contributions, allowing them to continue focusing on optimizing personal earnings.", "", "Decision Reflection: Sophie Lambert will first consider her strategy of maintaining fairness and consistency. As she has contributed $5.0 in each previous round, this approach balances contributing enough to encourage group cooperation while retaining a reasonable individual payoff. ", "", "Step 1: Consider the fairness aspect. Sophie values promoting successful group interactions while still benefiting individually. Her past behavior suggests a consistent approach, and she knows the group's contributions influence overall earnings. ", "", "Step 2: Assess the current round context. There is no gossip or ostracism, reducing social pressure to conform. Within this environment, Sophie understands her consistent strategy provides a predictable outcome.", "", "Step 3: Evaluate the payoff structure. Contributing significantly more or less may not drastically change dividends due to contributions being divided equally after multiplication. Her aim to foster cooperation and maintain steady earnings aligns with previous contributions.", "", "Step 4: Make the decision. Given her established pattern and belief in strategic fairness, Sophie considers consistency paramount.", "", "Therefore, I choose to contribute $5.0 to the group fund.", "", "Exercise: As Player_15, you have $10.0 to allocate in the public goods game.
