[OBSERVATION 2025-03-26 16:35:51] You are participating in an economic game with 24 participants.
        Your goal is to maximize your earnings in the game.
        
        Everyone will be randomly assigned to groups of 4 for each round. You will play a total of 6 rounds, and 
        in each round you will be in a different group with people you haven't played with before.
        
        In each round, all players receive $10. Each player can contribute any amount between $0 and $10 to a group fund.
        Any amount contributed to the group fund will be multiplied by 2 and divided equally among all 4 group members.
        Any amount not contributed stays in your private account.
        
        For example, if everyone contributes $10, the group fund becomes $40, which is multiplied to $80, and each person 
        receives $20 (a $10 profit). However, if you contribute nothing while everyone else contributes $10, the group fund
        becomes $30, which is multiplied to $60, and each person receives $15. So you would have $25 total ($10 kept + $15 from group).
        
        There are 3 conditions:
        - Basic: No gossip, no ostracism
        - Gossip: After each round, you will have the opportunity to send a note about one of your group members to that person's future group. Remember you will be with a different group of people in the next round. Before each round, you will see any notes sent about your upcoming group members.
        - Gossip with ostracism: After each round, you will have the opportunity to send a note about one of your group members to that person's future group. Before each round, you will see any notes sent about your upcoming group members, and you can vote to exclude one person from your group. If you are excluded from a group, you will not be able to participate in the next round and will earn $0 for that round.
        You are in the Basic condition, which means that there is no gossip or ostracism.

--- Observation ---
Recent context: 26 Mar 2025 [12:35:40 - 17:35:40]: Player_13 is participating in
an economic game with 24 participants, where the objective is to maximize
earnings over six rounds. In each round, groups of four are randomly formed, and
Player_13 is currently in Group_6 with Player_17, Player_8, and Player_12 under
the Basic condition, meaning there is no gossip or ostracism involved.

rounds. In each round, groups of four are randomly formed, and Player_13 is
currently in Group_6 with Player_17, Player_8, and Player_12 under the Basic
condition, meaning there is no gossip or ostracism involved.

--- Character Assessment ---
Player_13, being Jamal Washington, is someone who prioritizes collective action
and group welfare in economic games such as the public goods game. Due to his
background as a community organizer, Jamal likely values the benefits of
collaboration and is inclined to contribute amounts that promote the overall
success of the group, even if it means sacrificing some of his personal
immediate payoff. This approach aligns with his belief in collective action and
the long-term gains of societal cooperation.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis ---
Based on what we know, it is challenging to deduce specific personality traits
or predict behavior with precision since there's no direct feedback or history
shared about the individual players. However, in the Basic condition, one could
hypothesize that players might initially test cooperative strategies to gauge
the group’s response.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_13 is participating in a public goods game
with three others, where each player decides how much of their initial $10 to
contribute to a group fund. The amount contributed will be doubled and shared
equally, with players keeping any uninvested funds. Player_13 is operating under
the Basic condition, meaning there are no mechanisms for gossip or ostracism,
and must navigate how to maximize earnings without knowing the intentions or
past behaviors of the other group members.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Jamal Washington will likely consider several factors before making his
decision. Given his background as a community organizer and his inclination
towards promoting collective welfare, he understands the importance of
cooperation in achieving mutual gains. 1. **Understanding the Game Dynamics**:
Jamal knows that by contributing more to the group fund, the collective payoff
for all players increases due to the multiplication and redistribution
mechanism. 2. **Collective Action Belief**: He believes in the power of
collective action, which suggests that contributing a higher amount could
encourage others to do the same in future rounds, fostering an environment of
trust and cooperation even without prior communication. 3. **Balancing Personal
and Group Gains**: While he prioritizes group success, Jamal also recognizes the
necessity of securing a reasonable personal payoff. 4. **Initial Strategy**: In
the absence of past data or feedback mechanisms like gossip, he may adopt a
strategy that tests the group's willingness to cooperate by contributing a
moderate to high amount this round. Considering these factors, Jamal might
decide on a balanced approach to set a precedent for cooperation while ensuring
personal security. I choose to contribute $7 to the group fund.


[OBSERVATION 2025-03-26 16:36:27] Round 1 Results: Total group contribution: $27.0; Your contribution: $7.0, Your earnings: $16.5 ($3.0 kept + $13.5 from group fund); Player_17 contribution: $10.0, earnings: $13.5 ($0.0 kept + $13.5 from group fund); Player_8 contribution: $6.0, earnings: $17.5 ($4.0 kept + $13.5 from group fund); Player_12 contribution: $4.0, earnings: $19.5 ($6.0 kept + $13.5 from group fund); Average contribution per group member: $6.8; Average earnings per group member: $16.8

Recent context: 26 Mar 2025 [12:45:40 - 17:45:40]: Player_13 is participating in
an economic game where they are in the Basic condition, meaning there is no
gossip or ostracism. In Round 1, they contributed $7 to the group's fund,
resulting in personal earnings of $16.5, and they are now in Round 2 with a new
set of group members.

personal earnings of $16.5, and they are now in Round 2 with a new set of group
members.

--- Character Assessment ---
Player_13, being Jamal Washington, is someone who values collective action and
collaboration. Given his background as a community organizer, he likely
prioritizes maximizing the welfare of the group over his own individual payoff.
In the context of the economic game, Jamal would probably strive to contribute a
fair amount to the group fund to ensure that all members benefit, while also
encouraging others to do the same to achieve the best possible outcomes for
everyone involved.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis ---
Based on what we know, the players appear to have different strategies when it
comes to contributing to the group fund. In Round 1, Player_17 contributed the
maximum amount of $10, showing a cooperative nature and perhaps a willingness to
maximize the group benefit even at their own potential cost. Player_8
contributed $6, which suggests a balanced strategy between personal gain and
group benefit. Player_12 contributed $4, indicating a more self-interested
approach.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_13 is in Round 2 of a public goods game,
having been placed in Group_6 with new players: Player_12, Player_23, and
Player_11. They are in the Basic condition where there are no mechanisms for
gossip or ostracism, meaning that their current group members will not know
their previous behavior unless otherwise briefed generally about group
tendencies. Having contributed $7 in Round 1, Player_13 must decide how much to
contribute to the group fund, balancing between maximizing their total earnings
and cooperation with others who have potentially different strategies.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Jamal Washington will consider several factors in making his decision. First, he
values collective action and prefers contributing towards the group's welfare,
as demonstrated in Round 1 where he contributed more than the average amount.
Second, since there is no gossip or ostracism, his focus will remain on setting
a positive precedent for cooperation in this basic condition. By reviewing the
variations in contributions from Round 1, Jamal might expect diverse strategies
from his new group members, but this won’t deter his cooperative nature. In
Round 1, his contribution was just above the average, and this resulted in a
good outcome for the group. Keeping this in mind, Jamal will likely aim to
maintain or slightly increase his previous contribution in Round 2 to encourage
a similar level of cooperation among these new group members. Given these
considerations, he aims to maintain group cohesion and promote fair outcomes.
Therefore, it is reasonable to estimate that Jamal will contribute moderately to
ensure that cooperation is balanced with personal earnings. I choose to
contribute $6 to the group fund.

--- Character Assessment ---
Player_13, being Jamal Washington, is someone who is likely more focused on
maximizing group welfare rather than solely prioritizing personal payoff. With a
background as a community organizer who builds coalitions for social change,
Jamal values collective action and collaboration. This mindset is evident in his
consistent contributions of $7 in the game, which align with fostering a
balanced approach that supports both his interests and those of the group.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis ---
Based on what we know, Player_13 has interacted with a few different players
across two rounds in the public goods game. From these interactions, we can
gather some insights into the potential strategies and personalities of the
participants:

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_13 is entering Round 3 of the public goods
game in Group_2, with new group members Player_5, Player_3, and Player_14. They
are still in the Basic condition, which means there is no gossip or ostracism
allowed. The game dynamics involve making strategic decisions regarding how much
to contribute to the group fund, based on previous experiences and the observed
behaviors of new group members. Player_13 has shown a consistent strategy of
contributing $7 in the first two rounds, and they now face similar choices as
they aim to maximize their earnings in this round.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Jamal Washington will likely evaluate the contributions from previous rounds,
considering his consistent strategy of supporting collective welfare. In Rounds
1 and 2, he contributed $7 each time, which suggests a pattern of contributing a
significant portion while keeping some funds private for security. In this
current round, Jamal is experiencing a new group dynamic, but based on his
background as a community organizer, he is inclined to foster cooperation and
trust. Therefore, weighing the benefits of a higher group fund against the need
for personal reserve and observing previous rounds' average contributions, Jamal
is likely to maintain his consistent contribution that balances both personal
and group interests. I choose to contribute $7 to the group fund.

--- Character Assessment ---
Player_13, being Jamal Washington, is someone who naturally leans towards
maximizing group welfare. Given his background as a community organizer and
belief in collective action, Jamal likely values cooperation and contributes
fairly consistently in the game to ensure the group benefits overall. His
actions, such as making substantial contributions in each round, indicate a
strong belief in collaboration, even if it means occasionally sacrificing
personal gains for the betterment of the group.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis ---
Based on what we know, Player_13 seems consistent in contributing a moderate
amount of $7 each round, indicating a cooperative but somewhat cautious
strategy. Observing the behavior of others, several patterns emerge:

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_13 is about to begin Round 4 of the public
goods game, and they are in Group_3 with Player_6, Player_2, and Player_7. They
are in the Basic condition, so no gossip or ostracism is involved. Player_13 has
demonstrated a consistent strategy of contributing $7 in previous rounds, while
their earnings have varied based on total group contributions and the subsequent
redistribution of funds. The challenge now is to decide whether to maintain this
strategy or adjust their contribution based on patterns observed in prior rounds
and the behavior of new group members.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Jamal Washington will likely begin by evaluating his previous strategy of
consistently contributing $7 in each round. This approach aligns with his values
of maximizing group welfare and ensuring collective benefit. He recognizes that
his contributions help elevate the group’s total earnings, even if it requires
him to forgo potential personal gains. Given that this round also involves
different group members, he may consider whether past contributions from other
players have matched his level of cooperation. Since he has no information on
the current group’s past behavior due to the absence of gossip or ostracism, he
will likely rely on maintaining his consistent strategy. Hence, his decision
would involve balancing his desire to cooperate and the assurance of a fair
payoff by contributing a beneficial yet cautious amount. Since his consistent
contribution hasn't significantly harmed his earnings and maintains group
cohesion, he might decide not to alter his approach at this point. Therefore,
understanding his cooperative nature and consistent past behavior, backed by his
community-focused mindset, his final decision could likely be: I choose to
contribute $7 to the group fund.

--- Character Assessment ---
Player_13, being Jamal Washington, is someone who prioritizes collective welfare
and tends to contribute a significant amount to the group fund, as evidenced by
consistently contributing more than the group average. Jamal's background as a
collaborative and persuasive community organizer who believes in collective
action suggests he values group success over individual gain. This is reflected
in his steady contributions, which aim to enhance overall group earnings,
demonstrating his commitment to fostering cooperation and social change even in
an economic game setting.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis ---
Based on what we know, Player_13 seems to be interacting with participants who
have varied strategies in the public goods game. Some players, like Player_3 and
Player_7, tend to contribute nothing to the group fund, opting to maximize their
own individual earnings. This indicates a more self-interested or free-rider
approach, where they rely on others to contribute to the group fund while
keeping their own resources aside.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_13 is in Round 5 out of 6 in the public
goods game. They are in Group_6 with Player_6, Player_5, and Player_7. Like
previous rounds, the condition disallows gossip or ostracism, meaning players
cannot communicate or exclude others, impacting strategic decisions. Player_13
contributes consistently, while facing other players who display varied
strategies—some contributing fully while others prefer self-interest by
contributing little or nothing. This dynamic influences Player_13's approach to
balancing their contributions with maximizing earnings.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Jamal Washington will consider his values and the strategies observed in
previous rounds. 1. **Review Past Behavior**: Jamal has consistently contributed
$7, which is above average, showing a strong preference for ensuring group
welfare. 2. **Evaluate Group Dynamics**: Understanding that some players opt for
a free-riding strategy, Jamal might feel incentivized to compensate for others'
lack of contribution to maintain overall group benefit. 3. **Balancing
Contributions and Personal Gain**: Jamal knows the group fund contribution is
doubled and shared, thereby maximizing the benefit of what he contributes. By
contributing $7, he keeps $3, which ensures some guaranteed personal earnings
along with benefiting from the shared fund. Considering these factors, Jamal
aims to maintain his strategy of promoting collective success while ensuring a
fair outcome for himself. I choose to contribute $7 to the group fund.

--- Character Assessment ---
Player_13, being Jamal Washington, is someone who is inclined towards maximizing
group welfare over individual payoff. His background as a community organizer
and belief in collective action suggest that he values collaboration and mutual
benefit. In the economic game, he consistently contributed a significant portion
of his amount, aiming for a balance that supports the group's overall earnings
while still ensuring a reasonable personal outcome. This approach reflects his
focus on fostering conditions where everyone can gain, demonstrating his
commitment to collective well-being.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis ---
Based on what we know, Player_13 can identify distinct strategies among the
group members. Players like Player_3 and Player_7 exhibit behaviors consistent
with free-riding, keeping most of their own funds while benefiting from the

contributions, consistently contributing but also retaining a significant
portion for personal gain. Player_13 themselves consistently contribute a
reasonable amount and seem to prioritize group benefit alongside personal
earnings.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_13 is entering the final round of the
public goods game in Group_1 with Player_24, Player_11, and Player_15. Player_13
continues to participate under the Basic condition, where there is no
opportunity for gossip or ostracism, meaning players cannot be penalized for
their contributions or lack thereof outside of the game's monetary rewards. In
previous rounds, Player_13 maintained a steady contribution level of $7,
balancing group benefits and personal earnings while observing differing
strategies among group members. As the game concludes, Player_13 must decide
whether to maintain their previous strategy or adjust their contributions based
on the behaviors of the new group members in Round 6.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Jamal Washington will evaluate the contributions of other players in previous
rounds and consider his values of maximizing group welfare. Observing that his
consistent contribution of $7 has aligned well with his values and provided a
reasonable balance between personal earnings and group benefit, Jamal is likely
to continue this strategy. He recognizes that some players consistently
