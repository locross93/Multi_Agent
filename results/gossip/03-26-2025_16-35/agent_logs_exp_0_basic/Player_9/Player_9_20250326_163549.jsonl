Player_9 varied their contributions, initially contributing but later opting to keep more funds, thereby maximizing personal earnings by taking advantage of group fund distributions.", "", "Character Assessment: Player_9, being Oliver Chang, is someone who tends to approach economic games with a focus on maximizing his own payoff. Given his background as a casino manager and his expert risk assessment skills, Oliver is likely to weigh the costs and benefits of his contributions carefully. His actions in the recent rounds reflect a calculated approach, where he initially tested cooperation but later decided to capitalize on the opportunity to increase his own earnings by contributing less. This suggests that Oliver prioritizes his individual gains over the collective welfare of the group in such competitive scenarios.", "", "Theory of Mind Analysis: Based on what we know, players in this public goods game appear to have varied strategies regarding contribution and retention of funds. Initially, some players, like Player_18 and Player_12, contributed more significantly to the group fund, indicating a possible inclination towards cooperative behavior or a strategy to encourage mutual benefit. However, as the game progressed, individual earnings became more prioritized for some, such as Player_9, who opted to retain more funds while benefiting from group contributions.", "", "Situation Analysis: The current situation is that Player_9 is in the final round of the public goods game, placed in Group_5 with Player_22, Player_2, and Player_21. With no gossip or ostracism possible in this Basic condition, Player_9 faces a strategic decision on how much to contribute, knowing that previous rounds have shown a tendency to maximize personal earnings by keeping a larger portion of their funds and leveraging the group's collective contribution to boost overall earnings. The focus now is on balancing contributions with the goal of maximizing final earnings while observing how group members might behave in this closing round.", "", "Decision Reflection: Oliver Chang will likely consider the potential payoff from both contributing to the group fund and keeping money for himself.

His observation shows that while others contribute variably, he benefits when others contribute more than he does.", "", "3. **Evaluation of Group Dynamics**: He realizes he isn't likely to be punished by the group for lower contributions because there\u2019s no gossip or ostracism.", "", "4. **Expected Contribution from Others**: Based on past rounds, he might expect other players to contribute around $4-$6 each, resulting in a total group contribution around $12 assuming everyone follows similar patterns. This would mean he gets a share of about $6 if the group earnings are doubled and split, regardless of his own contribution.", "", "5. **Possible Outcomes**: If Oliver contributes nothing, he retains $10 in his account but still benefits from the collective pool. If he contributes a small amount, he might influence others to do the same, but his overall earnings might not increase unless others maintain high contributions.", "", "6. **Final Decision**: To balance between risk and maximizing his pay off, Oliver might choose to contribute minimally, enough to not appear completely exploitative but still retain a solid portion of his funds.", "   ", "Thus, taking all these into account:", "", "I choose to contribute $1.0 to the group fund.", "", "Exercise: As Player_9, you have $10.0 to allocate in the public goods game.
