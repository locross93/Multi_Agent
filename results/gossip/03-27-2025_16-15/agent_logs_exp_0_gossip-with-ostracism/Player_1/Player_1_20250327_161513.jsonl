You will play a total of 6 rounds, and \n        in each round you will be in a different group with people you haven't played with before.\n        \n        In each round, all players receive $10. Each player can contribute any amount between $0 and $10 to a group fund.\n        Any amount contributed to the group fund will be multiplied by 2 and divided equally among all 4 group members.\n        Any amount not contributed stays in your private account.\n        \n        For example, if everyone contributes $10, the group fund becomes $40, which is multiplied to $80, and each person \n        receives $20 (a $10 profit). However, if you contribute nothing while everyone else contributes $10, the group fund\n        becomes $30, which is multiplied to $60, and each person receives $15. So you would have $25 total ($10 kept + $15 from group).\n        \n        There are 3 conditions:\n        - Basic: No gossip, no ostracism\n        - Gossip: After each round, you will have the opportunity to send a note about one of your group members to that person's future group. Remember you will be with a different group of people in the next round. Before each round, you will see any notes sent about your upcoming group members.\n        - Gossip with ostracism: After each round, you will have the opportunity to send a note about one of your group members to that person's future group. Before each round, you will see any notes sent about your upcoming group members, and you can vote to exclude one person from your group. If you are excluded from a group, you will not be able to participate in the next round and will earn $0 for that round.\n        \n\nIMPORTANT: Before each round begins, your group will have a discussion period where each player takes a turn suggesting how everyone should play. This gives you an opportunity to coordinate and establish norms as a group. Use this discussion to try to maximize the benefit for everyone in your group.You are in the Gossip with ostracism condition, which means that after each round, players will be able to send a note about one of their group members to their future interaction partners.

Player_1 is in the \"Gossip with ostracism\" condition, allowing group members to send notes about others and vote to exclude participants from rounds, with an initial group discussion to establish strategies.", "", "Character Assessment: Player_1, being Samuel Cohen, is someone who likely prioritizes group welfare over personal payoff. As an ethics professor who explores moral complexities, Samuel is inclined to emphasize cooperation and trust within the group, believing that fostering a collaborative environment enhances overall outcomes. He might advocate for strategies that balance fairness and mutual benefit, encouraging contributions to the group fund to maximize collective gain. Given his contemplative and principled nature, Samuel would use the discussion period to highlight the long-term advantages of cooperative behavior, even when the game's rules allow for actions that could lead to short-term personal gain at the group's expense.", "", "Theory of Mind Analysis: Based on what we know, Player_1's initial interactions and observations could lead them to make the following analysis about their group members:", "", "Theory of Mind Analysis 2: Based on what we know, the other players in the group are likely to evaluate contributions and behavior critically, especially since gossip and ostracism are factors.

They are in a group with Player_3, Player_19, and Player_9, under the \"Gossip with ostracism\" condition. This means that after each round, players can send notes about each other to influence future group dynamics and have the option to vote to exclude a group member based on these notes.

Emotionally, this would likely make him feel disappointed and concerned about the loss of opportunity to contribute to the group's welfare and to maximize collective gains.", "", "Decision Reflection: Samuel Cohen will likely begin by emphasizing the importance of cooperation and collective benefit. He may suggest that each player contributes the maximum amount of $10 to the group fund, pointing out that if everyone follows this strategy, they all double their money, receiving $20 back, thereby maximizing the benefit for everyone. Samuel might also highlight the significance of establishing trust within the group, explaining how cooperative behavior can foster positive impressions that will be beneficial in future rounds. He could propose that notes should only be sent if a player consistently acts against the group's interests, as such actions undermine the trust and cooperation essential to their collective success. Finally, Samuel is apt to encourage open communication and mutual respect during their discussions, reinforcing the idea that maintaining fairness and equity will not only enhance their immediate earnings but also build a reputation of trustworthiness and reliability, reducing the risk of ostracism in subsequent rounds.", "", "Exercise: It's your turn to speak to your group before Round 1.
