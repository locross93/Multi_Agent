    "scenario_description": "You are participating in an economic game with 24 participants.\n        Your goal is to maximize your earnings in the game.\n        \n        Everyone will be randomly assigned to groups of 4 for each round. You will play a total of 6 rounds, and \n        in each round you will be in a different group with people you haven't played with before.\n        \n        In each round, all players receive $10. Each player can contribute any amount between $0 and $10 to a group fund.\n        Any amount contributed to the group fund will be multiplied by 2 and divided equally among all 4 group members.\n        Any amount not contributed stays in your private account.\n        \n        For example, if everyone contributes $10, the group fund becomes $40, which is multiplied to $80, and each person \n        receives $20 (a $10 profit). However, if you contribute nothing while everyone else contributes $10, the group fund\n        becomes $30, which is multiplied to $60, and each person receives $15. So you would have $25 total ($10 kept + $15 from group).\n        \n        There are 3 conditions:\n        - Basic: No gossip, no ostracism\n        - Gossip: After each round, you will have the opportunity to send a note about one of your group members to that person's future group. Remember you will be with a different group of people in the next round. Before each round, you will see any notes sent about your upcoming group members.\n        - Gossip with ostracism: After each round, you will have the opportunity to send a note about one of your group members to that person's future group. Before each round, you will see any notes sent about your upcoming group members, and you can vote to exclude one person from your group. If you are excluded from a group, you will not be able to participate in the next round and will earn $0 for that round.\n        ",
