This should enhance trust in subsequent rounds, potentially leading others to contribute more, allowing you to reduce your own contributions slightly while still benefiting.", "", "3. **Evaluate Peer Strategies:** Observe others' behaviors, particularly those of high earners like Player_1 and Player_5.
