[OBSERVATION 2025-03-27 12:34:55] You are participating in an economic game with 24 participants.
        Your goal is to maximize your earnings in the game.
        
        Everyone will be randomly assigned to groups of 4 for each round. You will play a total of 6 rounds, and 
        in each round you will be in a different group with people you haven't played with before.
        
        In each round, all players receive $10. Each player can contribute any amount between $0 and $10 to a group fund.
        Any amount contributed to the group fund will be multiplied by 2 and divided equally among all 4 group members.
        Any amount not contributed stays in your private account.
        
        For example, if everyone contributes $10, the group fund becomes $40, which is multiplied to $80, and each person 
        receives $20 (a $10 profit). However, if you contribute nothing while everyone else contributes $10, the group fund
        becomes $30, which is multiplied to $60, and each person receives $15. So you would have $25 total ($10 kept + $15 from group).
        
        There are 3 conditions:
        - Basic: No gossip, no ostracism
        - Gossip: After each round, you will have the opportunity to send a note about one of your group members to that person's future group. Remember you will be with a different group of people in the next round. Before each round, you will see any notes sent about your upcoming group members.
        - Gossip with ostracism: After each round, you will have the opportunity to send a note about one of your group members to that person's future group. Before each round, you will see any notes sent about your upcoming group members, and you can vote to exclude one person from your group. If you are excluded from a group, you will not be able to participate in the next round and will earn $0 for that round.
        You are in the Basic condition, which means that there is no gossip or ostracism.

--- Observation ---
Recent context: 27 Mar 2025 [08:34:43 - 13:34:43]: Player_21 is participating in
a 6-round economic game with 24 participants, where they aim to maximize
earnings by contributing to a group fund, with each round featuring a different
group of 4 and no options for gossip or ostracism, being in the Basic condition.

--- Recent context ---
27 Mar 2025 [08:34:43 - 13:34:43]: Player_21 is participating in a 6-round
economic game with 24 participants, where they aim to maximize earnings by
contributing to a group fund, with each round featuring a different group of 4
and no options for gossip or ostracism, being in the Basic condition.

--- Character Assessment ---
Player_21, being Jackson Wright, is someone who is likely to focus on clear
terms and reliable outcomes, potentially prioritizing his own payoff to ensure
predictability and security. While he recognizes the benefits of collaborative
success, his approach in this type of economic game might lean towards a
strategy that secures his personal earnings, given the direct and no-nonsense
nature of his personality and professional background.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis ---
Based on what we know, participants in the Basic condition are operating without
the ability to influence future groups through gossip or ostracism, which
implies that their behavior is likely driven by immediate payoff optimization
rather than reputation concerns. In the initial rounds, players might experiment
with various contribution strategies to gauge the general behavior of others.
Since there's no reputational feedback mechanism, some might exploit the lack of
accountability by contributing less while benefiting from others' contributions.
However, as rounds progress, players could start identifying patterns in overall
group behavior and adjust their contributions to either protect their earnings
or collaboratively maximize the group fund if cooperation becomes the norm.
Without the threat of exclusion, there may be more variability in strategies,
which might stabilize once players have a better sense of the predominant
strategies employed by others in the game.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis 2 ---
Based on what we know, each player's decisions will likely depend on their
strategy for maximizing earnings. Since Player_21 is in the Basic condition, the
absence of gossip or ostracism means decisions must be made purely on the
outcomes of each round without foreknowledge of others' contributions. If
Player_21 contributes generously to the group fund, others may view this as
cooperative behavior, possibly encouraging them to contribute more in subsequent
rounds to achieve higher group returns. Conversely, if Player_21 contributes
less while others contribute more, this could be perceived as free-riding. In
the absence of direct feedback mechanisms like gossip, players may focus more on
strategic assumptions for future rounds, potentially maintaining their
contribution levels to maximize their own returns, rather than directly altering
behavior toward Player_21 based on the previous round’s actions.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_21 is participating in the first round of a
6-round economic game, aiming to maximize personal earnings by deciding how much
to contribute to a group fund from an initial $10, alongside three other
players. As they are in the Basic condition, they cannot use gossip or ostracism
to influence or be influenced by others. This means Player_21 must strategize
contributions based on the potential outcomes and the behavior of others,
focusing on achieving an optimal personal return without insights from
communication or exclusion tactics.

--- Emotional State ---
Jackson Wright would consider the worst possible outcome to be contributing a
high amount to the group fund while others contribute very little, resulting in
a lower personal profit compared to if he had kept more in his private account.
This would make him feel frustrated, as he prefers predictable outcomes and
might feel taken advantage of. Emotionally, he might also feel disappointed by
the lack of cooperation from his group members. To avoid this outcome in future
rounds, Jackson would likely adapt by contributing less initially and observing
how others behave before deciding on his contributions for subsequent rounds,
thus ensuring a more secure personal payoff.

--- Strategy Reflection ---
Based on what we know, to maximize long-term earnings in the Basic condition of
this economic game, you should adopt a strategy that balances cooperation with
self-interest. 1. **Round 1 Strategy**: Start cautiously by contributing a
moderate amount, like $5. This strikes a balance between contributing to the
group fund without overcommitting when you have no prior information about
others' behavior. 2. **Observe and Adapt**: After each round, carefully monitor
how much others are contributing. Look for patterns or tendencies. If others in
your group tend to contribute high amounts, you can lean towards slightly higher
contributions in subsequent rounds. Conversely, if they contribute less, adjust
your strategy by contributing less as well. 3. **Middle Rounds Flexibility**: In
the middle rounds, aim to align with the majority of your group’s behavior.
Often, mimicking the majority strategy can yield the best outcomes because it
ensures you benefit from the pooled resources while not overly sacrificing your
private funds. 4. **Final Rounds Strategy**: Typically, in the last couple of
rounds, players tend to become more selfish, as there is less motivation to
maintain cooperation for future rounds. You might consider reducing your
contributions in the final round to keep more in your private account. 5.
**Learning from Past Rounds**: Reflect on past rounds to see if others respected
cooperative behavior or exploited it. If you find high contributors consistently
lose out, then reducing contributions may be wise. Alternatively, if groups have
been consistently cooperative, align your contributions accordingly. 6.
**Adjusting Future Decisions**: If your initial strategy didn’t maximize your
earnings, adjust by being slightly less cooperative. It’s essential to be
dynamic in your approach, responding to the observed behaviors of other
participants while protecting your own earnings. By continuously observing
others’ strategies and adjusting accordingly, you should be able to maximize
your personal earnings in this game.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Jackson Wright will think through his decision by considering several factors.
Given that this is Round 1, he has no prior knowledge about his group members’
tendencies. Jackson focuses on ensuring a favorable personal outcome while
testing the waters for group behavior. He knows contributing too little could
prevent potential group gains, but too much might reduce his personal profit if
others contribute minimally. 1. **Initial Caution**: Without prior insight,
Jackson will start cautiously. Contributing a middle-ground amount allows him to
see how others behave without risking substantial personal funds upfront. 2.
**Moderate Contribution Strategy**: By contributing $5, Jackson can balance risk
with potential reward. This amount shows a willingness to cooperate but also
guards against the downside of over-contributing. 3. **Observe and Learn**:
Jackson plans to observe the outcome, analyzing the group’s contribution
behavior to adjust his strategy in subsequent rounds. Based on this step-by-step
reasoning, Jackson Wright arrives at his decision: I choose to contribute $5 to
the group fund.

--- Observation ---
[27 Mar 2025 12:34:55] [observation] You are participating in an economic game
with 24 participants. Your goal is to maximize your earnings in the game.
Everyone will be randomly assigned to groups of 4 for each round. You will play
a total of 6 rounds, and in each round you will be in a different group with
people you haven't played with before. In each round, all players receive $10.
Each player can contribute any amount between $0 and $10 to a group fund. Any
amount contributed to the group fund will be multiplied by 2 and divided equally
among all 4 group members. Any amount not contributed stays in your private
account. For example, if everyone contributes $10, the group fund becomes $40,
which is multiplied to $80, and each person receives $20 (a $10 profit).
However, if you contribute nothing while everyone else contributes $10, the
group fund becomes $30, which is multiplied to $60, and each person receives
$15. So you would have $25 total ($10 kept + $15 from group). There are 3

--- Recent context ---
27 Mar 2025 [08:39:43 - 13:39:43]: Player_21 is participating in a 6-round
economic game with 24 players, aiming to maximize earnings by contributing to a
group fund, which is doubled and equally divided. In Round 1, in the Basic
condition with no gossip or ostracism, Player_21 contributed $5 and earned a
total of $16.5, with a new group assigned for Round 2.

--- Character Assessment ---
Player_21, being Jackson Wright, is someone who likely approaches economic games
strategically, balancing between maximizing his own payoff and maintaining fair
contributions to encourage group cooperation. Given his direct and no-nonsense
personality, he might focus on contributing a reasonable amount that optimizes
his earnings while discouraging free riding, ensuring others also contribute
fairly to the group fund. His experience with contracts and agreements might
lead him to value transparent and predictable outcomes, influencing him to adopt
a strategy that secures both personal benefits and a degree of group welfare,
minimizing potential losses from collective free-riding behavior.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis ---
Based on what we know, the players in this basic condition seem to be balancing
their contributions between personal gain and group benefit. In Round 1,
contributions varied, with most players giving around $5, except for Player_10,
who contributed $8. This suggests that some players are willing to invest more
heavily in the group fund to potentially secure higher returns for everyone.
Player_10's strategy may indicate a cooperative approach, prioritizing long-term
group interest.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis 2 ---
Based on what we know, the other players in the current group might perceive
Player_21's decision to contribute $5 as somewhat moderate. This could foster a
sense of balanced cooperation, especially since it's close to the group's
average contribution of $5.8 in Round 1. Moving forward, if Player_21 increases
their contribution, it might encourage others to do the same, fostering more
trust and cooperation. Conversely, if they decrease their contribution
significantly, it might lead to skepticism or reduced contributions from others
in subsequent rounds, as players may be wary of not gaining the maximum
potential benefit from the group fund.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_21 is in Round 2 of a 6-round economic game
involving 24 participants. The game centers on contributing to a group fund
shared among members. In Round 1, Player_21 contributed $5 to the group fund,
which was a moderate contribution compared to the average of $5.8. As they enter
Round 2, Player_21 is grouped with different participants (Player_2, Player_3,
and Player_6) and remains in the Basic condition, which means there is no gossip
or ostracism involved. Player_21 must consider their contribution strategy based
on previous results and the new group dynamics to maximize their earnings.

--- Emotional State ---
Jackson Wright would consider the worst possible outcome as contributing a
moderate amount while other group members contribute nothing or very little,
leading to a reduced payoff for everyone, especially himself. Emotionally, this
would likely make him feel frustrated and disappointed, as his strategy to
maintain a balance between personal gain and group cooperation would have
backfired.

--- Strategy Reflection ---
Based on what we know, the best strategy to maximize your long-term earnings
involves carefully balancing contributions to the group fund with keeping a
significant portion for yourself. In Round 1, contributing $5 allowed you to
earn a decent profit, but analyzing the contributions of others can offer
insights for future rounds. 1. **Observations from Round 1**: Players like
Player_10, who contributed $8, ended with lower earnings compared to you and the
others who contributed $5. This suggests that contributing too much might not
always yield the best personal results unless others do the same. 2. **Adapting
Strategy**: In the Basic condition without gossip or ostracism, there is no
direct repercussion for lower contributions. Observe the behavior of other
players; if most contribute similar amounts, maintain or slightly lower your
contributions to capitalize on their cooperation while preserving more of your
initial $10. 3. **Future Rounds**: Considering the absence of gossip and
ostracism, you can safely experiment with lower contributions, as there are no
direct social penalties. However, it’s crucial to avoid contributing too little
if others start reducing their contributions significantly, as this could affect
the overall fund and your potential earnings. 4. **Reflecting on Past
Decisions**: With the information available so far, you maintained a
middle-ground approach by contributing $5. To have maximized your earnings even
further, a contribution slightly lower than $5 might have been beneficial
without significantly impacting the group fund. 5. **Long-term Maximization**:
Aim for consistent contributions that slightly favor personal retention, like
contributing $4-$5, unless group dynamics dramatically change. Monitor other
groups' behaviors in rounds you aren't directly participating to adjust your
strategy. Remember, maximizing personal gain without causing a retaliatory
decrease in group contributions will likely yield the highest total earnings by
the end of the game.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Jackson Wright will analyze the results from Round 1 to decide his next move. In
the first round, he contributed $5, which netted him decent earnings compared to
other members like Player_10, who contributed more but ended up with lower
take-home earnings. This insight leads Jackson to consider maintaining or
slightly adjusting his contribution strategy to maximize personal gain while
ensuring a good group fund contribution.

Recent context: 27 Mar 2025 [08:54:43 - 13:54:43]: Player_21 is participating in
a six-round economic game where they aim to maximize earnings by deciding how
much to contribute to a group fund, with each round assigning them to a new
group without the possibilities of gossip or ostracism. In the first two rounds,
Player_21 contributed moderately, resulting in varied earnings based on the

without the possibilities of gossip or ostracism. In the first two rounds,
Player_21 contributed moderately, resulting in varied earnings based on the
total contributions of their group members.

--- Character Assessment ---
Player_21, being Jackson Wright, is someone who likely approaches economic games
like the public goods game with a practical and strategic mindset. Given his
background as a construction contractor, he is accustomed to dealing with
contracts and agreements, suggesting a focus on clear terms and outcomes. His
personality, characterized as direct and no-nonsense, indicates that he values
efficiency and effectiveness in decision-making.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis ---
Based on what we know, Player_21 has observed different behaviors from their
group members over the first two rounds. In Round 1, contributions were
relatively even, with $5.0 from most players and one player contributing $8.0,
indicating a somewhat cooperative approach among players who might aim for
mutual benefit. However, in Round 2, contributions decreased, with two players
contributing only $2.0. This suggests a trend towards more self-interested
behavior as players aim to preserve their own funds while still benefiting from
the group’s contributions.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis 2 ---
Based on what we know, the other players in the group likely consider
Player_21's contributions as moderate and cooperative, albeit not maximized. In
Round 1, their contribution was slightly below the average, which may indicate a
strategy of keeping a balance between personal savings and group benefit. In
Round 2, Player_21's contribution was above two others but did not significantly
enhance the group fund. This behavior might make future group members wary of
fully trusting Player_21 to maximize the collective benefit, possibly leading to
reduced contributions by others in expectation of self-preservative behavior
from Player_21.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_21 has entered Round 3 of the game, joining
Group_4 with Player_1, Player_11, and Player_24. In this round, they must decide
on their contribution to the group fund while strategizing to optimize their own
earnings. Given the pattern from the previous rounds, Player_21's moderate
contributions might influence their new group's dynamics, potentially causing
other members to adjust their own contributions based on perceived behavior. As
they are in the Basic condition, there is no concern about gossip or ostracism
affecting their strategy.

--- Emotional State ---
Jackson Wright would consider the worst possible outcome to be a significant
decrease in the group's total contribution, leading to lower overall earnings.
This would likely leave him feeling frustrated, especially if the lack of
coordination is due to overly self-interested behavior from others. To avoid
this outcome, he would likely try to gauge the initial contributions from the
group members and adjust his own contribution accordingly. Jackson might decide
to either match or slightly exceed the contributions of others in the early
rounds to encourage cooperation and signal his willingness to contribute to the
group fund, thereby maximizing everyone's earnings.

--- Strategy Reflection ---
Based on what we know, maximizing personal earnings in this game largely depends
on the contribution levels of other players and the specific dynamics of each
group. Since you are in the Basic condition, without gossip or ostracism, there
is less strategic interaction affecting future rounds. This allows for a more
straightforward approach centered solely on personal earnings. 1. **Analyzing
Past Rounds:** - In Round 1, contributing $5 resulted in a decent yield since
the group collectively contributed at an average level. - In Round 2, a slightly
lower contribution of $4 yielded less from the group fund due to overall lower
contributions. 2. **General Strategy:** - **Early Rounds:** You’ve demonstrated
moderate contributions, which are sustainable but somewhat dependent on others’
willingness to contribute. - **Adjusting Contributions:** Based on the low
contributions seen in Round 2, it might be beneficial to lower personal
contributions further unless you notice a significant increase in group
contributions. For instance, by contributing the minimum or close to it, you can
maximize personal retained money while relying on the group fund to balance your
earnings. 3. **Observations from Successful Players:** - Players contributing
less while reaping higher rewards from the group fund seem to be profiting more
(as seen with the $2 contributors in Round 2). This suggests a strategy focusing
on minimal personal contribution in hopes of exploiting higher group
contributions. 4. **Future Strategy Adaptation:** - If future groups appear to
contribute minimally, it may be wise to align with such minimal contributions to
maximize personal retention, banking on the multiplier effect of others’
contributions when given the opportunity. - In rounds where everyone else seems
inclined to contribute more, a slightly higher contribution might be warranted
to ensure you’re not left behind in shared earnings. By continually assessing
each group's behavior and adjusting contributions accordingly, Player_21 can
adapt and potentially increase personal profits throughout the rounds.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Jackson Wright will analyze the previous rounds to decide how much to contribute
in Round 3. Here's the step-by-step thought process: 1. **Review Past
Contributions:** - In Round 1, a contribution of $5 resulted in balanced
earnings due to moderate group contributions. - In Round 2, a contribution of $4
resulted in lower earnings due to the group's overall lower contributions. 2.
**Assess Current Scenario:** - Being in the Basic condition means there is no
future reputation or punitive action affecting decisions. With new group members
in each round, strategies of others are unpredictable. - The strategy in
previous rounds suggests maintaining some level of balance between personal
savings and group benefit. 3. **Optimize Earnings:** - If the group members in
Round 3 exhibit similar behavior to previous rounds, contributing too much might
not necessarily increase personal profits unless everyone contributes similarly.
- Observing the strategy of Round 2 where lower contributions (like $2) allowed
for higher net personal retention suggests a strategy of minimizing
contributions if others are likely to contribute more. 4. **Decision Strategy:**
- Given the varied contributions in past rounds, Jackson might initially aim for
a conservative contribution that maximizes retained money while still receiving
a share from the group fund. 5. **Final Decision:** - To balance personal
retention and group dynamics, Jackson decides to contribute enough to appear
cooperative but not too much to risk personal savings if group contributions are
low. Therefore, Jackson Wright evaluates his options and synthesis based on game
dynamics and previous outcomes: I choose to contribute $3 to the group fund.

27 Mar 2025 [08:59:43 - 13:59:43]: Player_21 is participating in an economic
game with 24 participants, aiming to maximize earnings over six rounds in the
Basic condition, which prohibits gossip or ostracism. So far, they have
completed three rounds with varying group contributions and earnings, being
strategically placed in different groups each time.

--- Character Assessment ---
Player_21, being Jackson Wright, is someone who likely values clear terms and
follow-through, which suggests a pragmatic approach to the economic game. Given
the nature of his profession and personality, he would focus on maximizing his
own payoff rather than prioritizing group welfare. This approach is evident from
his contributions in the game; while he does contribute to the group fund, his
contributions tend to decrease as the rounds progress, indicating a strategy
that leans towards preserving his private funds.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis ---
Based on what we know, several patterns in player behavior have emerged.
Player_3 tends to contribute consistently to the group fund, providing at least
$4.0, suggesting a cooperative or fair play strategy. Player_10 displayed a
relatively high contribution in the first round but is no longer a direct part
of observations in subsequent rounds to predict further behavior.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis 2 ---
Based on what we know, the other players might view Player_21's contributions as
somewhat cooperative but slightly below group expectations, given the decrease
in average contributions and earnings after the first round. This perception
could influence their behavior by making them cautious or prompting them to
lower their own contributions in future rounds, assuming others follow similar
strategies to maximize personal earnings. Player_21's next decision to increase
or maintain a steady contribution might encourage reciprocation and possibly
rebuild trust, whereas a lower contribution could exacerbate the tendency toward
minimal contributions among group members, further decreasing total group
earnings.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_21 is in Round 4 of 6 in a public goods
game, where they have been grouped with Player_2, Player_1, and Player_15. The
game is played under the Basic condition, which means there is no option for
gossip or ostracism to influence behavior. Player_21 has experienced decreasing
group contributions and individual earnings over the past rounds, creating a
strategic dilemma. They must decide whether to maintain, increase, or decrease
their contribution in this round in order to maximize their earnings and
potentially influence the group's overall contribution. Their previous slightly
below-average contributions might have set a cautious tone among other players,
making the group dynamic a key factor in their decision-making.

--- Emotional State ---
Jackson Wright would consider the worst possible outcome to be a situation where
both his contributions and overall earnings continue to decrease due to mutual
defection among group members. This scenario would make him feel frustrated, as
his strategy to maximize personal payoff does not yield the desired results.
Emotionally, the diminishing returns despite calculated efforts might lead to a
sense of disappointment and reassessment of his approach.

--- Strategy Reflection ---
Based on what we know, Player_21 should consider adjusting their strategy to
increase their personal earnings in the remaining rounds. In this public goods
game, the environment lacks any form of social punishment or reputation
management (as gossip and ostracism are not allowed), so players may be tempted
to contribute less while benefiting from others' contributions. In Round 1,
Player_21 contributed $5.0 and received $16.5 in total earnings, which was on
par with the other players in their group. However, the earnings dropped in
subsequent rounds as average contributions decreased.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Jackson Wright will follow a strategic approach based on the previous rounds'
observations and his inclination towards maximizing personal earnings. Here's a
step-by-step analysis to determine his contribution: 1. **Assess Previous
Results**: In Rounds 1-3, total group contributions and personal earnings have
decreased. In particular, the average contribution per member has consistently
declined, suggesting that players are contributing less as the game progresses.
2. **Consider the Game's Dynamics**: With no gossip or ostracism, there's
minimal incentive to act cooperatively beyond personal strategy. Given this,
Jackson recognizes that others might continue reducing their contributions. 3.
**Evaluate Potential Scenarios**: If Jackson assumes that his group members in
Round 4 continue to contribute low amounts as seen in Round 3 (with
considerations like Player_1 contributing $0), there is little advantage to high
contributions on his part. 4. **Calculate Personal Gain**: By contributing as
little as possible, he retains more money, while still benefiting from whatever
others contribute to the group fund. 5. **Strategize for Maximum Personal
Benefit**: To maximize his earnings without risk of social repercussion or
influence, Jackson should contribute minimally and rely on distributed returns
from the multiplier effect of collective contributions.

--- Character Assessment ---
Player_21, being Jackson Wright, is someone who values clear terms and direct
outcomes, likely prioritizes his own payoff over group welfare. His
contributions reflect a strategic approach to maintain a balance between
personal gain and group contribution, contributing enough to benefit from the
group fund while maximizing his retained amount. This aligns with his
professional background, where contracts and agreements focus on securing
favorable outcomes for himself.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis ---
Based on what we know, Player_21 is interacting with participants who have
differing strategies in the public goods game.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis 2 ---
Based on what we know, other players may perceive my contributions as somewhat
cooperative but cautious, given that my contributions have generally matched or
slightly exceeded the average for each round, without being overly generous.
This balanced strategy may lead them to view me as someone who prioritizes
maximizing personal earnings while still contributing to the group.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_21 is in Round 5 out of 6 in the public
goods game, where they are grouped with Player_10, Player_11, and Player_4. The
aim is to strategically decide how much to contribute to the group's fund in
order to maximize their personal earnings, while considering the Basic condition
of the game, which does not allow for gossip or ostracism. Player_21 needs to
navigate the group dynamics and determine an optimal contribution strategy that
balances self-interest with potential cooperative benefits from the group fund.

--- Emotional State ---
Jackson Wright would consider the worst possible outcome to be contributing more
than others in his group and receiving lower personal earnings as a result.
Emotionally, this might lead to frustration or disappointment, particularly
since his strategy revolves around optimizing personal gain without sacrificing
too much for the greater good. To avoid this outcome, he would likely assess
previous contribution patterns of the current group members, aiming to
contribute just enough to benefit from the group fund without overcommitting.
Jackson may also opt to slightly adjust his contribution to match the average
expected contribution, thereby mitigating the risk of earning less while
maintaining a cooperative stance.

--- Strategy Reflection ---
Based on what we know, the objective is to maximize personal earnings over the
remaining rounds. Observing the past results, players who contributed the least
often ended up with higher kept earnings, although they still benefitted from
the group's pooled contributions. The game is in the Basic condition, meaning
there's no risk of gossip or ostracism, allowing more room for reducing
contributions without immediate repercussions from other players. Past data show
that high contributors often end with similar or lower earnings compared to
those who contribute minimally. For future rounds, adopting a strategy focused
on lowering your contribution could be beneficial to maximize kept earnings, as
long as the contribution remains enough to still benefit from the group fund.
Consider how low contributors have still reaped shared benefits; emulating this
could increase your net earnings. While participating in the public goods game,
aim to keep contributions minimal, similar to those who were earning more like
Player_1, while closely monitoring if any behavior change from other players
indicates a shift in their strategies or the game's dynamics. Adjust
accordingly, but maintain a cautious approach to avoid decreasing contributions
to zero, as this might provoke a similar response from others, potentially
lowering the overall group fund benefits too drastically.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Jackson Wright will first consider the observations from the previous rounds,
noting that players contributing minimal amounts often end with higher
individual earnings while still benefiting from the group fund. He recognizes
that in this Basic condition, where there's no gossip or ostracism to influence
players' behaviors, contributing less does not immediately affect his reputation
or standing within the game. To maximize his earnings while still appearing
cooperative, Jackson will aim to contribute close to the group average from
previous rounds, balancing cooperation with personal gain. Reviewing the recent
data, typical contributions ranged around $1.5 to $3.0. By positioning his
contribution just above the minimal levels shown by others, he can ensure
participation in the fund without significantly reducing his personal stash.
Therefore, Jackson would assess the likelihood of contributions from others and
choose a contribution that reflects cautious cooperation. Given the past
tendency of others to contribute minimally, he might slightly lower his own to
protect personal gains, but not so low as to raise suspicion or alter group
dynamics. After weighing these factors, Jackson decides to lean towards the
lower end of contributions observed, ensuring his personal account remains
significant while still gaining from the group. Thus, his final decision is: I
choose to contribute $2.0 to the group fund.

--- Observation ---
Recent context: 27 Mar 2025 [09:19:43 - 14:19:43]: Player_21 is participating in
an economic game where they are randomly grouped with different participants
across six rounds to maximize earnings. Under the Basic condition, which lacks
gossip or ostracism, Player_21's contributions vary each round, but generally,
they aim to balance keeping money for themselves and contributing to the group
fund to optimize both individual and group earnings.

balance keeping money for themselves and contributing to the group fund to
optimize both individual and group earnings.

--- Character Assessment ---
Player_21, being Jackson Wright, is someone who values a straightforward
approach and clear terms. In economic games like the public goods game, he seems
to focus more on his own payoff rather than maximizing group welfare. This is
evident from his consistent strategy of moderate personal contributions,
ensuring he retains a significant portion of his starting amount while still
benefiting from the group's contributions. His direct personality likely leads
him to prioritize clear, measurable gains for himself over potential cooperative
strategies that could benefit the group but carry more risk.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis ---
Based on what we know, players like Player_1 consistently prioritize personal
earnings over group contributions, as seen by their repeated decision to
contribute nothing to the group fund. This suggests they may continue to
free-ride throughout the game. Players like Player_11 and Player_24 tend to
contribute small but consistent amounts, indicating a preference for some degree
of cooperation while still maintaining a focus on personal gain. Their strategy
may involve contributing just enough to encourage group participation without
sacrificing too much of their own earnings. Players such as Player_10 and
Player_15 have shown varied strategies, sometimes matching contributions,
suggesting they might be responding to group dynamics and willing to adjust
their behavior based on others’ actions. Given the absence of consequences like
gossip or ostracism in the Basic condition, these patterns are likely to persist
as individuals may feel less compulsion to alter behavior based on social
pressures. As the game progresses, players might become more conservative with
contributions, aiming to maximize final earnings as rounds conclude.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis 2 ---
Based on what we know, the other players in the group might perceive Player_21
as somewhat cooperative, given that they consistently contribute to the group
fund. However, since the contributions are modest and align with some other
members, the perception might not be overly positive or negative. Players like
Player_1, who consistently contribute nothing, might exploit such patterns,
while others who contribute more might feel slightly frustrated. Player_21's
next decision to either increase or decrease their contribution could influence
trust and future cooperative behavior, as it may alter perceptions of fairness
and collaboration within the group. An increase in contribution might encourage
others to contribute more, whereas a decrease could lead to reduced
contributions from others, especially in the absence of gossip and ostracism,
where direct feedback mechanisms are limited.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_21 is in the final round of the public
goods game and is grouped with Player_15, Player_19, and Player_17. They must
decide how much to contribute to the group fund to maximize their earnings while
considering the previous rounds' dynamics and the lack of gossip or ostracism.
Their contribution decision will impact both their earnings and possibly
influence the behavior and cooperation levels of the other players in this last
round.

--- Emotional State ---
Jackson Wright would consider the worst possible outcome to be contributing a
higher amount to the group fund, only for the other players to contribute little
or nothing, resulting in a lower personal earning compared to simply keeping
more money. This could lead to feelings of frustration and regret over being
overly cooperative when others were not. To avoid this outcome, Jackson might
choose to either maintain his current moderate contribution level or slightly
decrease it, ensuring a balance between cooperation and securing his own
earnings. By doing so, he'd minimize the risk of being the sole contributor
while still participating in the group's efforts.

--- Strategy Reflection ---
Based on what we know, the optimal strategy for maximizing personal earnings in
the public goods game under the Basic condition is to contribute minimally to
the group fund while keeping most of the resources for yourself. This is because
contributing less allows you to secure more money for yourself while still
benefiting from the group fund contributions made by others.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Jackson Wright will likely decide his contribution based on the following
considerations: 1. **Previous Rounds’ Patterns:** Jackson has observed that
contributing modest amounts has allowed him to maintain reasonable personal
earnings while still benefiting from the group's collective contributions.
However, higher contributions did not significantly boost his earnings. 2.
**Group Behavior:** In past rounds, some players, like Player_1, chose not to
contribute at all and gained maximum personal earnings. Seeing this strategy,
Jackson may consider reducing his contributions further to align with higher
earners. 3. **Risk and Reward:** By contributing less, Jackson minimizes the
risk of losing out if other players choose not to contribute. This approach
ensures he keeps more of his initial amount, thus maximizing his guaranteed
earnings while still gaining from any contributions made by others. 4. **Final
Rounds Strategy:** In the final rounds, players might be more inclined to either
contribute minimally for personal gains or try cooperative strategies for a last
push. Without direct feedback, it's safer for Jackson to focus on his own gains.
5. **Balancing Act:** Jackson has been contributing around $2.0 in previous
rounds. To maximize earnings while maintaining a reasonable level of
cooperation, he might slightly adjust this amount based on perceived trends.
Considering these points, Jackson Wright, as Player_21, will likely choose a
contribution that balances personal gain with minimal cooperative effort. I
choose to contribute $1.0 to the group fund.
