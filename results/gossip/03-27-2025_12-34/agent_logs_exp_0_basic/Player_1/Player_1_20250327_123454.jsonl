In cooperative settings like public goods games, players generally expect others to contribute fairly to maximize group benefits.

In Round 1 and 2, Player_1 contributed $2 and earned in line with or above the group average. In Round 3, a $0 contribution led to maximizing kept earnings while still receiving from the group fund. Observing outcomes, the top strategy seems to involve contributing minimally in order to maximize personal retained earnings, especially since there are no repercussions like gossip or ostracism for low contributions.", "", "Going forward, Player_1 should consider maintaining low contributions, as long as other players do not greatly increase theirs.
