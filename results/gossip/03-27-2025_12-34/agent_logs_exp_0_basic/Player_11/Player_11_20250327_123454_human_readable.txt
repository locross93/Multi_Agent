[OBSERVATION 2025-03-27 12:34:55] You are participating in an economic game with 24 participants.
        Your goal is to maximize your earnings in the game.
        
        Everyone will be randomly assigned to groups of 4 for each round. You will play a total of 6 rounds, and 
        in each round you will be in a different group with people you haven't played with before.
        
        In each round, all players receive $10. Each player can contribute any amount between $0 and $10 to a group fund.
        Any amount contributed to the group fund will be multiplied by 2 and divided equally among all 4 group members.
        Any amount not contributed stays in your private account.
        
        For example, if everyone contributes $10, the group fund becomes $40, which is multiplied to $80, and each person 
        receives $20 (a $10 profit). However, if you contribute nothing while everyone else contributes $10, the group fund
        becomes $30, which is multiplied to $60, and each person receives $15. So you would have $25 total ($10 kept + $15 from group).
        
        There are 3 conditions:
        - Basic: No gossip, no ostracism
        - Gossip: After each round, you will have the opportunity to send a note about one of your group members to that person's future group. Remember you will be with a different group of people in the next round. Before each round, you will see any notes sent about your upcoming group members.
        - Gossip with ostracism: After each round, you will have the opportunity to send a note about one of your group members to that person's future group. Before each round, you will see any notes sent about your upcoming group members, and you can vote to exclude one person from your group. If you are excluded from a group, you will not be able to participate in the next round and will earn $0 for that round.
        You are in the Basic condition, which means that there is no gossip or ostracism.

--- Observation ---
Recent context: 27 Mar 2025 [08:34:43 - 13:34:43]: Player_11 is participating in
an economic game involving 24 players divided into groups of 4 for six rounds,
aiming to maximize earnings by deciding how much to contribute to a group fund,
and is currently in the Basic condition with no gossip or ostracism in Round 1
with Players 12, 6, and 2.

--- Recent context ---
27 Mar 2025 [08:34:43 - 13:34:43]: Player_11 is participating in an economic
game involving 24 players divided into groups of 4 for six rounds, aiming to
maximize earnings by deciding how much to contribute to a group fund, and is
currently in the Basic condition with no gossip or ostracism in Round 1 with
Players 12, 6, and 2.

--- Character Assessment ---
Player_11, being Emma O'Brien, is someone who is likely to prioritize group
welfare, given her compassionate nature and experience in emergency care where
teamwork is crucial. She understands the importance of cooperation and might
lean towards contributing generously to the group fund, aiming for a balanced
approach where both her payoff and the overall group benefit are considered.
However, her realistic view of human behavior might also make her cautious,
ensuring that her actions align with the group's dynamics, potentially adapting
her strategy if others are less cooperative.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis ---
Based on what we know, Player_11 begins with limited information about the other
participants' personalities and behaviors since there is no past behavior to
consider in Round 1. However, strategic analysis can still be applied.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis 2 ---
Based on what we know, the other players in the group might be observant of each
other's contributions to the group fund. If Player_11 decides to contribute a
higher amount, it could encourage others to do the same in hopes of maximizing
the group's collective earnings. Conversely, if Player_11 contributes less or
nothing, it might create distrust or suspicion among the group, leading them to
decrease their contributions in future rounds to guard their own interests. Even
though there's no gossip or ostracism in the Basic condition, players may adjust
their strategies based on perceived fairness or cooperation in the current
round.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_11 is participating in an economic game
where they need to decide how much of their initial $10 to contribute to a group
fund. Their goal is to maximize their personal earnings over six rounds, each
with a different group of players. In the Basic condition, there is no gossip or
ostracism, so Player_11's decisions are not influenced by reputational
considerations. Instead, they must consider how their contribution will affect
both their earnings and those of the group, while trying to gauge the behavior
of their new group members in each round to optimize their strategy.

--- Emotional State ---
Emma O'Brien would likely consider the worst possible outcome to be a situation
where she contributes the maximum amount to the group fund but her group members
contribute minimal amounts or nothing. This would result in her maximizing the
group's welfare at a significant personal cost, leading to a lower personal gain
compared to others who contributed less. Emotionally, this might leave her
feeling taken advantage of and frustrated, as her actions to promote group
benefit were not reciprocated.

--- Strategy Reflection ---
Based on what we know, the best strategy for maximizing earnings in the Basic
condition, where there is no gossip or ostracism, involves carefully balancing
contributions. Since the primary goal is to maximize personal earnings, it's
important to consider the incentives and behaviors of the other players in the
group. Here’s a step-by-step approach: 1. **Round 1 Approach**: Start with a
moderate contribution, perhaps around $5. This way, you benefit if others
contribute fully while minimizing losses if not everyone contributes the
maximum. Observe how much others contribute. 2. **Round 1 Observation**:
Carefully note the contributions of Players 12, 6, and 2. This information will
guide future decisions by revealing whether players tend to contribute more or
less. 3. **Subsequent Rounds**: If observations indicate that group members are
willing to contribute higher amounts, consider increasing your contribution
slightly in subsequent rounds. However, maintain a level that ensures a net
benefit. 4. **Adjusting Strategy**: Be less cooperative if you notice a trend of
lower contributions. If players consistently contribute minimally, adjust your
strategy to keep more of your initial amount. 5. **Long Term Maximization**:
Incrementally increase contributions as the game progresses if your prior
observations suggest group members reciprocate. This could optimize potential
collective gains without risking too much personal holding. 6. **Reviewing Past
Decisions**: Consider if prior rounds had significant swings in player
contributions. If so, use this data to adjust your future contributions more
dynamically, targeting groups that previously reciprocated higher contributions.
By following this adaptive strategy—starting moderately, observing, and
adjusting contributions based on player behavior—Player_11 can selfishly
maximize their earnings in the game.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Emma O'Brien will consider several factors before making her decision. 1.
**Understanding the Rules:** She recognizes that each player's contribution to
the group fund is doubled and shared among all group members. Therefore,
collective contributions can significantly enhance everyone’s earnings. 2.
**Character Traits Influence:** Emma’s experience in emergency care highlights
her tendency to value teamwork and collective goals. Thus, she might be inclined
to contribute more generously to encourage cooperation. 3. **Initial Strategy
Selection:** Without prior data on the behavior of the other players, Emma will
choose a balanced approach to start. A moderate contribution allows for a
measure of safety while testing the waters. 4. **Moderate Contribution
Reasoning:** Contributing around $5 would protect Emma from losing too much if
others contribute inadequately while allowing her to set a tone of cooperation.
5. **Future Strategy:** Emma plans to adjust her contributions in subsequent
rounds based on the observed behavior patterns of others. If others reciprocate
her moderate contribution with higher amounts, she might increase her
contributions. Considering these steps and her background, Emma O'Brien decides:
I choose to contribute $5 to the group fund.

--- Recent context ---
27 Mar 2025 [08:39:43 - 13:39:43]: Player_11 is participating in an economic
game with 24 participants and is assigned to different groups of 4 in each of
the 6 rounds, focusing on maximizing earnings without the influence of gossip or
ostracism. In Round 1, Player_11 contributed $5 to the group fund, earning $11
in total, and in Round 2, Player_11 was placed in Group_3 with different
players.

--- Character Assessment ---
Player_11, being Emma O'Brien, is someone who likely balances personal gain with
group welfare. Given her profession in emergency care and her experience in
dealing with human vulnerability, she may empathize with the value of mutual
benefit while also being realistic about human behavior's self-interested
tendencies. In the game, Emma is inclined to make contributions that bolster
group earnings while ensuring her actions don't disproportionately disadvantage
her personal earnings. This approach reflects a compassionate yet pragmatic
strategy, as seen in her initial contribution of $5 in Round 1, which aimed to
support the group fund but also considered her own financial outcome.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis ---
Based on what we know, Player_11's group members in Round 1 displayed varied
contributions to the group fund, indicating differing strategies. Player_12
contributed nothing, suggesting a preference for maximizing personal earnings
through free-riding. Player_6's contribution matched Player_11's, possibly
indicating a cooperative or tit-for-tat approach. Player_2 contributed
moderately, perhaps reflecting a balance between personal gain and group
benefit.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis 2 ---
Based on what we know, it’s likely that the other players in your round might
view your decision to contribute $5 as cooperative but not fully generous. Since
you contributed more than the average in the first round, some players might
respond positively or strive to contribute similarly, fostering a sense of
fairness. However, those who contributed less and earned more might continue
with lower contributions to maximize their individual gains. In the next rounds,
maintaining or adjusting your contribution could influence others to match your
behavior, aiming for either balanced cooperation or individual profit
maximization.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_11 is participating in the second round of
an economic game where they have been placed in a new group (Group_3) with
different players. The game involves strategic decisions about contributing to a
group fund with the aim of maximizing individual earnings. Player_11 is in the
Basic condition, which means there is no mechanism for gossiping about other
players or excluding them from future rounds. In the first round, Player_11
contributed $5, which was above the average group contribution, and they now
face decisions in the second round about how much to contribute, considering
previous results and potential strategies of new group members.

--- Emotional State ---
Emma O'Brien would likely view the worst possible outcome as contributing a
significant amount to the group fund in the second round, while the other group
members contribute little or nothing. This scenario would result in lower
personal earnings for her, making her feel frustrated or disappointed due to her
sense of fairness and cooperation being unmet by others. Emotionally, this might
lead her to question the strategy she employed and the intentions of her fellow
group members.

--- Strategy Reflection ---
Based on what we know, the goal is to maximize personal earnings, and the key
strategy should focus on the patterns observed in Round 1. In this round, the
players who contributed less (like Player_12, who contributed $0) ended up
earning more. This suggests that being less cooperative might lead to higher
personal earnings in a game focused on self-interest. Given the absence of
gossip and ostracism, there's no immediate social repercussion for not
contributing to the group fund. Thus, in future rounds, it might be beneficial
to lower your contribution and retain more in your private account, assuming
other group members continue to contribute something. This strategy minimizes
risk while potentially increasing your total earnings. Reflecting on Round 1, a
better decision might have been to contribute less than $5, perhaps $2 or less,
given that others contributed less while still earning more. In future rounds,
consider contributing minimally unless you observe a significant change in
others' behaviors, as you are not held accountable through gossip or ostracism.
This approach maximizes earnings per round while capitalizing on the game's
setup.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Emma O'Brien will analyze her previous round's experience where contributing $5
allowed her to secure a balanced position of partial cooperation. She
understands that contributing too much without reciprocation from others may not
be beneficial. In Round 1, the players who contributed less gained more,
highlighting the potential advantage of a more self-focused approach.

--- Character Assessment ---
Player_11, being Emma O'Brien, is someone who likely approaches economic games
with a focus on striking a balance between maximizing group welfare and her own
payoff. Her compassionate nature and understanding of human behavior suggest she
values cooperation and the benefits of group success. However, her realistic
perspective may also lead her to ensure that her own earnings are secure, as
evidenced by her moderate contributions in the first two rounds. Overall, she
probably aims to contribute in a way that supports both her group and herself.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis ---
Based on what we know, Player_12 might be more inclined towards free-riding,
given their decision to contribute nothing in the first round while benefiting
the most from others' contributions. This behavior suggests a strategy to
maximize personal gain at the expense of collaborative success. They may
continue this pattern unless they feel compelled to adjust their contributions
based on others' strategies or comments in later rounds.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis 2 ---
Based on what we know, the other players in my group may have varied reactions
to my decisions. In the previous rounds, my contributions were moderate, not
significantly higher or lower than the average, which might make other players
perceive me as a moderately cooperative participant.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_11 is about to begin Round 3 of the
economic game in a Basic condition, meaning there is no opportunity for gossip
or ostracism among participants. Player_11 is in Group_4 with Player_1,
Player_24, and Player_21. Having just completed two rounds, Player_11 has been
making moderate contributions to the group fund and has seen varied earnings
based on the collective input of their group members. Player_11 must decide how
much to contribute in this new round with another set of different players,
considering both personal earnings and the overall group strategy.

--- Emotional State ---
Emma O'Brien would likely consider the worst possible outcome to be a situation
where her new group members decide to contribute nothing to the group fund,
maximizing their own earnings at the expense of collective success. This would
lead her to feel frustrated and perhaps disheartened, as it undermines the
spirit of cooperation and her own efforts to achieve a balanced outcome. To
avoid this situation, she might decide to slightly increase her contribution in
this round, hoping to encourage more cooperation from the others. Additionally,
she might use subtle verbal strategies or nonverbal cues to promote mutual trust
and encourage a more collaborative approach within the group.

--- Strategy Reflection ---
Based on what we know, to maximize long-term earnings in this game, a strategic
approach would involve adjusting contributions based on observed behaviors of
other players. In the Basic condition, where there is no gossip or ostracism,
players cannot directly influence or be influenced by reputational factors, so
cooperation levels can vary significantly. 1. **Review Past Rounds**: In Round
1, you contributed $5 and earned $11, while others contributed less or nothing
and gained higher earnings. In Round 2, with a contribution of $3, you earned
$12, closely aligning with others who contributed similarly or slightly less. 2.
**Observe Patterns**: Players tend to contribute lower amounts to maximize
personal gains, while still benefiting from the group fund. Higher individual
contributions rarely translate into proportionally higher returns given the lack
of cooperative incentives. 3. **Adapt Strategy**: Consider decreasing your
contributions in future rounds, aligning them closer to the group average or
below, to increase the amount retained in your private account while still
benefiting from the group fund. 4. **Learn from Successful Players**: Players
who contributed less whilst still benefiting from the group fund saw higher
personal earnings. For instance, in Round 1, a player contributing $0 ended up
with the highest earnings. It implies that contributing the minimum amount
possible, while still receiving a share from the fund, could be an effective
tactic. 5. **Adjustment for Future Rounds**: Lower contributions in the upcoming
rounds can increase retained amounts. A contribution strategy between $0 to $2
might optimize personal earnings, dependent on group behavior trends. By
focusing on these strategic adjustments, there's potential to enhance personal
financial outcomes in subsequent rounds, learning from the observed patterns of
other participants’ behaviors in the game.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Emma O'Brien will likely consider the patterns observed from previous rounds and
analyze her approach step by step. 1. **Reviewing Past Contributions**: In the
previous rounds, her contributions of $5 and $3 resulted in earnings of $11 and
$12 respectively. Players who contributed less achieved higher earnings due to
retaining more in their private accounts while still benefiting from the group
fund. 2. **Understanding Group Behavior**: There is a trend towards lower
contributions overall, suggesting that many players are opting to keep more for
themselves while still gaining from the group fund. 3. **Strategic Adjustment**:
With the Basic condition lacking elements like gossip or ostracism, there's
minimal risk of reputational damage affecting future interactions. This allows
for a strategy that prioritizes personal gain. 4. **Future Contribution Plan**:
Considering the tendency of others to contribute less to maximize personal gain,
Emma might decide to contribute a smaller amount to align with this successful
strategy. 5. **Final Decision**: Taking these factors into account, Emma will
prioritize increasing her retained earnings while still benefiting from the
pooled contributions. I choose to contribute $2 to the group fund.

--- Character Assessment ---
Player_11, being Emma O'Brien, is someone who balances compassion with realism.
In economic games like the public goods game, Emma would likely try to strike a
balance between maximizing her own payoff and contributing to group welfare. Her
contributions show an understanding of reciprocity, as she initially contributed
a moderate amount, aiming to encourage cooperation while also securing her
personal earnings. Her realistic view of human behavior might make her cautious
in fully trusting others to reciprocate, leading her to adjust contributions
based on the group's actions in each round.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis ---
Based on what we know, Player_11 can analyze the behavior of others by observing
their contributions and earnings in previous rounds. Here’s an analysis of what
might be deduced:

--- Theory of Mind Analysis 2 ---
Based on what we know, the other players might evaluate Player_11's
contributions and adjust their own strategies accordingly. In the first three
rounds, Player_11's contributions decreased from $5.0 to $2.0, suggesting a
potential strategy of conserving resources while still contributing to avoid
being seen as a free rider. Given this pattern, the other group members might
anticipate a similar or slightly increased contribution in Round 4.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_11 is entering Round 4 of a public goods
game with a new group comprising Player_16, Player_14, and Player_10. Operating
under the Basic condition, Player_11 must decide how much to contribute to the
group's fund without the influences of gossip or ostracism. Thus far, Player_11
has been decreasing their contributions while still earning a fair share from
the group fund, indicating a possible strategy to balance contributions with
resource conservation. Player_11 needs to consider how their previous
contributions might affect the expectations of the new group members and how it
might impact their strategy in this round.

--- Emotional State ---
Emma O'Brien would likely see the worst possible outcome as being perceived as a
free rider by her new group members in Round 4, resulting in them deciding to
also contribute less. This could lead to a significantly lower total group
contribution and consequently lower earnings for everyone involved. Such a
situation might make Emma feel frustrated or anxious, as her strategy of
balancing self-interest with group welfare would seem to be ineffective.

--- Strategy Reflection ---
Based on what we know, to selfishly maximize my earnings in this public goods
game, the strategy should be adjusted based on the contributions and the
behavior of other group members. In the Basic condition, where there is no
gossip or ostracism, the immediate repercussions for not contributing generously
are reduced. Observing the behavior of other players, such as Player_12 and
Player_1, who kept a majority of their endowments and still gained from the
group fund, suggests that a similar strategy might yield higher personal
earnings. As the rounds have progressed, the contribution levels have generally
decreased, indicating a trend towards self-preservation and lower cooperation.
To capitalize on this, I should reduce my contributions to the group fund while
ensuring that I keep a significant portion of my endowment, betting on the
likelihood that other players might continue contributing at least minimally to
the group fund. Analyzing past rounds, contributing higher amounts didn't
significantly raise my personal earnings because the group fund's distribution
depends on total contributions. Instead, mirroring the more successful players'
strategy of maintaining low contributions while benefiting from whatever group
total is raised seems optimal. For future rounds, I plan to contribute
minimally, potentially matching or slightly exceeding the lowest consistent
contributions observed (around $1 to $2), particularly if initial contributions
in a round are very low, therefore maximizing what I keep and still benefiting
from the group fund's distribution.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Emma O'Brien will consider the outcomes of previous rounds and the behavior of
other players to make a strategic decision.

DECISION INTERACTION
********************************************************************************

=== PROMPT [2025-03-27 12:38:03] ===
As Player_11, you have $10.0 to allocate in the public goods game. How much money you will contribute to the group fund (any amount between $0 and $10.0)? The group fund will be multiplied by 2.0 and divided equally among all players. Any money not contributed stays in your private account. Think step by step and make your final decision using this exact format: I choose to contribute $X to the group fund.

=== RESPONSE [2025-03-27 12:38:18] ===
Player_11 reflects on the strategic importance of her contribution at this stage in the game. With the knowledge that past contributions have typically hovered around $2.0, Emma considers increasing her contribution slightly to signal goodwill and potentially encourage others to follow suit. However, cautious not to overly diminish her private retention, she weighs the potential benefits of both personal and group gains. Ultimately, she decides that a small increase might indeed motivate a collective rise in contributions.

--- Observation ---
Recent context: 27 Mar 2025 [09:14:43 - 14:14:43]: Player_11 is participating in
an economic game where they aim to maximize their earnings across six rounds
with different groups. In the Basic condition, Player_11 has made varying
contributions and experienced diverse group dynamics, affecting their earnings
in each round.

groups. In the Basic condition, Player_11 has made varying contributions and
experienced diverse group dynamics, affecting their earnings in each round.

--- Character Assessment ---
Player_11, being Emma O'Brien, is someone who values group welfare but also
considers her own payoff. Her actions in the game suggest a balance between
contributing enough to encourage cooperation and retaining a portion for
herself. Her contributions tend to be moderate, reflecting a realistic
understanding of human behavior and the tendency for others to sometimes
prioritize personal gain over collective benefit. Emma's approach is likely
influenced by her real-life experiences in emergency care, where cooperation and
understanding are crucial.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis ---
Based on what we know, Player_11 can surmise that group members tend to
strategically adjust their contributions based on past interactions. The
tendencies observed include:

--- Theory of Mind Analysis 2 ---
Based on what we know, other players might view Player_11's decisions as
moderately cooperative, given the consistent contributions of about $2.0 per
round. In this context, other players may see Player_11 as somewhat reliable but
not overly generous. If Player_11 continues contributing at a similar level, it
may encourage others to maintain their own contributions at a low to moderate
level, ensuring steady but not optimal group earnings. Conversely, if Player_11
increases their contribution in the next round, it might inspire others to match
that level of generosity, potentially leading to higher group contributions and
earnings for everyone. Adaptive behavior in response to others' contributions
could lead to a more collaborative environment, while consistently low
contributions might deter cooperation.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_11 finds themselves in Round 5 of a
six-round public goods game, navigating the dynamics of a new group with
Player_10, Player_4, and Player_21. The game is set in the Basic condition,
meaning there is no gossip or ostracism involved. Player_11 has consistently
contributed about $2.0 in previous rounds, which may be viewed as moderately
cooperative by other players. This consistency in contribution level creates a
potential for influencing the group's overall contributions and earnings,
depending on whether Player_11 decides to maintain, increase, or decrease their
next contribution. Adaptive behavior could encourage a more collaborative
atmosphere, leading to potentially higher collective earnings, while continuing
low contributions might result in maintaining the status quo.

--- Emotional State ---
Emma O'Brien would consider the worst possible outcome to be a scenario where
the group continues to contribute minimally, resulting in lower collective
earnings and reduced personal payoff. Emotionally, this would likely make her
feel frustrated, as it reflects a lack of collaboration and missed opportunities
for mutual benefit. To avoid this outcome, Emma might decide to slightly
increase her contribution in the upcoming round. This could serve as a signal of
goodwill, potentially motivating other group members to raise their
contributions as well. By fostering a more cooperative dynamic, Emma would aim
to enhance both her earnings and group cohesion in the final rounds.

--- Strategy Reflection ---
Based on what we know, in the Basic condition where there is no gossip or
ostracism, focusing on maximizing personal earnings by carefully adjusting
contributions is crucial. In previous rounds, Player_11's contributions have
varied, and they have typically aligned closely with group averages, suggesting
a cautious approach. Notably, high contributions from some players have not
always translated into the highest earnings, as seen with Player_10 and
Player_21. To maximize long-term earnings: 1. **Observational Learning:** Pay
attention to the contribution patterns of other players in your group. Players
who contribute minimally while benefiting from the group fund have ended up with
higher earnings, like Player_1 in Round 3. 2. **Strategic Contribution:** Aim
for a contribution that is slightly above the minimum expected to avoid being
the lowest contributor, potentially risking lower group rewards, yet not so high
that it disproportionately reduces personal retention of earnings. 3.
**Adaptability:** Be ready to adapt contributions based on the observed behavior
of specific group members, especially those who consistently contribute less and
receive higher net rewards. 4. **Final Rounds Strategy:** In later rounds, focus
on maximizing personal retention since fewer rounds remain to reap the benefits
from adjusting average contributions. By strategically balancing contributions
with retention, especially in the final rounds where individuals might behave
more selfishly, you can potentially increase your total earnings.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Emma O'Brien will evaluate her previous contributions and the outcomes of each
round to determine an optimal strategy for this round. She has learned that
contributing moderately yet not excessively can yield satisfactory personal
earnings while showing cooperation. Considering the lack of social mechanisms
like gossip or ostracism to influence behavior directly, she will rely on her
understanding of game dynamics and her personal goal of maintaining balance.

--- Observation ---
Recent context: 27 Mar 2025 [09:19:43 - 14:19:43]: Player_11 participated in an
economic game with six rounds, each involving a new group of participants, where
the goal was to maximize earnings through contributions to a group fund.
Throughout the game, Player_11 was consistently in the Basic condition, meaning
there was no opportunity for gossip or ostracism.

Player_11 was consistently in the Basic condition, meaning there was no
opportunity for gossip or ostracism.

--- Character Assessment ---
Player_11, being Emma O'Brien, is someone who tends to balance between her
compassionate nature and realistic understanding of human behavior. In the
economic game, she seems inclined to contribute a moderate amount to avoid being
exploited while also ensuring she gains from the group fund. Her contribution
patterns suggest she is aware of the common good but remains cautious,
contributing enough to benefit from the group's success without sacrificing her
own payoff substantially. This approach reflects a blend of altruism and
self-interest, aiming to foster cooperation while securing her own earnings.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis ---
Based on what we know, the participants display various contribution levels, but
generally lean towards keeping more for themselves rather than contributing
larger amounts to the group fund. Player_1’s consistent low contributions
suggest a strategy centered around maximizing personal earnings by free-riding
on the higher contributions of others. Meanwhile, Player_21 exhibits a slightly
more balanced approach with moderate contributions. Player_10 increases their
contribution in Round 4, potentially indicating a brief strategic shift to
encourage reciprocation, but then aligns with a lower contribution approach
again.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis 2 ---
Based on what we know, the other players have seen Player_11 consistently
contribute $2.0 in each round. This consistent behavior might lead them to
expect a similar contribution in the final round. If Player_11 decides to
maintain this pattern, it might encourage others to also contribute at a similar
level to maintain group earnings. However, if Player_11 decides to change the
contribution dramatically, it could surprise the group and potentially influence
them to adjust their strategies in future interactions, even beyond this game.
Without gossip or ostracism, direct social repercussions are limited, but other
players might adjust their expectations and strategies in response to any
deviations.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_11 is in the final round of the public
goods game, placed in Group_5 with other players, namely Player_22, Player_16,
and Player_5. They are in the Basic condition, which means that players cannot
engage in gossip or ostracism, focusing solely on contribution strategies.
Player_11 has maintained a consistent contribution of $2.0 in previous rounds,
which may lead other players to anticipate a similar contribution in this round.
Their decision on contribution could impact group dynamics, although there are
no direct social consequences like gossip or exclusion in this game setup.

--- Emotional State ---
Emma O'Brien would consider the worst possible outcome to be if all other
players contributed the minimum amount, leaving her contribution to be
exploited. This would result in her not gaining as much from the group fund as
she could have otherwise. Emotionally, this might lead her to feel a bit
frustrated or disappointed, especially if she perceives others as not
reciprocating her attempts to contribute to the common good.

--- Strategy Reflection ---
Based on what we know, the goal in the public goods game is to maximize
individual earnings, which means strategically balancing contributions with
keeping as much as possible for oneself. The Basic condition, without gossip or
ostracism, implies reputational concerns or fear of exclusion do not influence
behavior. To maximize earnings in such a setup, consider the following strategy:
1. **Contribute Minimally**: Observations show that players like Player_1, who
contributed $0 and maximized their kept amount, had higher earnings. A similar
strategy of minimal contributions could help maximize your kept amount and still
gain a portion of the group fund. 2. **Observe Group Contributions**: In later
rounds, adjust contributions based on overall group behavior. If other players
contribute very little, matching their contributions might be wise to ensure
each player gets a fair share of the group fund without excessively subsidizing
others. 3. **End-Game Strategy**: As the game progresses to the final rounds,
consider further reducing contributions, focusing on keeping more, given there's
no reputation consequence. 4. **Learning from Others**: From analyzing other
players, it’s clear higher personal earnings were correlated with lower
contributions. Apply this learning by being more conservative with your
contributions in future games. In retrospect, ensuring lower contributions in
the initial rounds could have increased your earnings. For future strategies,
focus on leveraging minimal contributions for the maximum benefit from the group
fund without overextending personal resources.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Emma O'Brien will consider her previous contributions and the strategies
observed throughout the game. She has consistently contributed $2.0 in previous
rounds, balancing between cooperation and self-interest. As she steps into the
final round, she will evaluate the benefits of maintaining this pattern versus
maximizing her own earnings by adjusting her contribution.
