To avoid this outcome, Leo Virtanen might focus on enhancing his cooperation with the group by slightly increasing his contribution in upcoming rounds to match or exceed the group average, thereby improving his reputation. Additionally, he could strategically use gossip notes to highlight cooperative behavior of group members or diplomatically address the actions of less cooperative individuals without resorting to targeting well-regarded players, ensuring a balance between honest feedback and maintaining group harmony.

This prevents negative gossip about being a low contributor, which could lead to exclusion, while still allowing retention of a considerable portion of funds for personal earnings.", "", "3. **Respond to Gossip**: Use gossip notes as a guide to adjust contributions. If other players are accused of under-contribution, increase your contribution slightly above theirs to appear as a more favorable group member. Conversely, if there's an opportunity where others reduce contributions, consider slightly lowering yours as well to maximize retention, but not so much that it risks exclusion.", "", "4. **Leverage Group Dynamics**: In groups with players who have been criticized for low contributions, increase contributions marginally to showcase a contrast.

This requires careful observation of gossip trends and adapting contributions to avoid criticism.", "", "6. **Evaluate Past Decisions**: Reflect on any rounds where contributions excessively favored personal gain at the expense of attracting negative gossip.
