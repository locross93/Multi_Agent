This scenario would likely evoke feelings of frustration and disappointment, as it would not only affect her earnings but also her reputation within the group. To avoid this outcome, she would likely choose to contribute generously to the group fund, aligning with her values of fairness and cooperation. Additionally, she might carefully craft a gossip note that emphasizes the positive contributions of trustworthy group members, further fostering a cooperative atmosphere and increasing the likelihood of being retained in the group.

In this scenario, players like Player_11 are praised for maximal contributions, fostering a cooperative atmosphere. This suggests that consistent cooperation might build trust and protect against ostracism.", "", "2. **Strategic Contributions**: In earlier rounds, it may have been beneficial to contribute just above the average to establish a reputation for cooperation while retaining more for personal gain.
