Given his background as a private investigator and his distrustful nature, Malcolm might approach economic games with a strategic mindset, always on the lookout for hidden motives and potential benefits to himself. He would probably contribute just enough to avoid negative gossip or repercussions while ensuring that his personal gains are maximized. His perceptive nature would also help him in assessing the contributions and behaviors of others, using this information to his advantage in terms of contribution strategy and which players might be worth targeting with gossip notes.", "", "Theory of Mind Analysis: Based on what we know, the players have shown a tendency to contribute moderately to the group fund, which suggests a strategy of balancing personal gain with group benefit.
