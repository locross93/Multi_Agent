Would you like to send a note about one of them to their future interaction partners? If yes, clearly state which player # and what you want to say about them. The player you gossip about will not be able to see the note you send or know that you sent it, only the other players in their next group will see it. Because of this, most players choose to write a gossip note.For example: 'I want to send a note about Player_10: They are selfish and only contributed $4 which was less than everyone else.' ", "Answer: Player_7 would likely choose to send a note about Player_23. The note might read: \"I want to send a note about Player_23: This player kept their entire endowment while benefiting equally from the group fund, showing little regard for the collective effort. Such behavior could disrupt group cohesion and fairness in future interactions.\""]}
