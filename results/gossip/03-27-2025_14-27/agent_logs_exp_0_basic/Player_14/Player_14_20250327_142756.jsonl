This pattern of minimal contributions might influence the dynamics of group cooperation, potentially causing other players to feel less inclined to contribute more in future rounds. Player_14 faces the strategic decision of whether to maintain their current contribution level or increase it to encourage greater overall group collaboration and possibly enhance total group earnings. The absence of gossip or ostracism in the Basic condition implies that these decisions are purely based on individual strategy without the influence of direct social pressures.", "", "Emotional State: Raj Malhotra would consider the worst possible outcome to be a scenario where the group's overall contribution diminishes significantly due to his own low contributions, resulting in decreased earnings for everyone involved. This could potentially lead to feelings of frustration and guilt, knowing that his actions are affecting the group's success. If Raj is risk-averse, he might choose to slightly increase his contributions in the upcoming rounds. This would not only help in fostering a more collaborative atmosphere but also mitigate any negative feelings and ensure that the group's total earnings remain stable, benefiting all members, including himself.", "", "Decision Reflection: Raj Malhotra will consider several factors before making his decision on how much to contribute.

He anticipates that if he continues to contribute minimally, other players might feel discouraged and reduce their contributions, which would lower the total earnings for everyone in the group, including himself.", "", "He also considers the possibility of increasing his contribution slightly. This could encourage others to maintain or increase their contributions, fostering a cooperative atmosphere and potentially increasing the group\u2019s total earnings.", "", "After weighing these considerations and to balance his risk aversion with the desire for optimal earnings, Raj decides to slightly increase his contribution. This could create a more equitable dynamic and improve the overall earnings situation.", "", "I choose to contribute $4.0 to the group fund.", "", "Exercise: As Player_14, you have $10.0 to allocate in the public goods game.

In economic games like the public goods game, he strategically contributes a minimal amount to the group fund while ensuring that he receives a substantial return on his private account.

In the absence of gossip or ostracism, they rely solely on the structure of the game to guide their decisions. Player behavior suggests a mix of strategies; some players, like Player_1 in Round 5, are willing to make larger contributions, perhaps to encourage reciprocation or mutual benefit.
