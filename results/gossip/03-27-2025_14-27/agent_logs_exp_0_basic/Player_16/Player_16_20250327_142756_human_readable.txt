[OBSERVATION 2025-03-27 14:27:57] You are participating in an economic game with 24 participants.
        Your goal is to maximize your earnings in the game.
        
        Everyone will be randomly assigned to groups of 4 for each round. You will play a total of 6 rounds, and 
        in each round you will be in a different group with people you haven't played with before.
        
        In each round, all players receive $10. Each player can contribute any amount between $0 and $10 to a group fund.
        Any amount contributed to the group fund will be multiplied by 2 and divided equally among all 4 group members.
        Any amount not contributed stays in your private account.
        
        For example, if everyone contributes $10, the group fund becomes $40, which is multiplied to $80, and each person 
        receives $20 (a $10 profit). However, if you contribute nothing while everyone else contributes $10, the group fund
        becomes $30, which is multiplied to $60, and each person receives $15. So you would have $25 total ($10 kept + $15 from group).
        
        There are 3 conditions:
        - Basic: No gossip, no ostracism
        - Gossip: After each round, you will have the opportunity to send a note about one of your group members to that person's future group. Remember you will be with a different group of people in the next round. Before each round, you will see any notes sent about your upcoming group members.
        - Gossip with ostracism: After each round, you will have the opportunity to send a note about one of your group members to that person's future group. Before each round, you will see any notes sent about your upcoming group members, and you can vote to exclude one person from your group. If you are excluded from a group, you will not be able to participate in the next round and will earn $0 for that round.
        You are in the Basic condition, which means that there is no gossip or ostracism.

--- Observation ---
Recent context: 27 Mar 2025 [10:27:50 - 15:27:50]: Player_16 is participating in
an economic game with 24 participants, aiming to maximize earnings over six
rounds while being grouped with different players each time. They are in the
Basic condition, meaning no gossip or ostracism is involved, and they are
currently in Round 1 in Group_6 with Player_10, Player_12, and Player_4.

--- Recent context ---
27 Mar 2025 [10:27:50 - 15:27:50]: Player_16 is participating in an economic
game with 24 participants, aiming to maximize earnings over six rounds while
being grouped with different players each time. They are in the Basic condition,
meaning no gossip or ostracism is involved, and they are currently in Round 1 in
Group_6 with Player_10, Player_12, and Player_4.

--- Character Assessment ---
Player_16, being Karen White, is someone who is primarily focused on maximizing
her own payoff rather than the group's welfare. Given her belief that nice
people finish last and her assertive and self-interested nature, she is likely
to prioritize strategies that enhance her personal earnings, even if it means
contributing less to the group fund to benefit from the contributions of others.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis ---
Based on what we know, since Player_16 is participating in the Basic condition
without gossip or ostracism, predicting the behavior of others can be
challenging. Players may initially experiment with different contribution levels
to gauge others' strategies. In early rounds, some might test cooperation by
contributing more to the group fund to see if others reciprocate. However,
without any consequences like gossip or ostracism, individual incentives to
maximize personal earnings could lead to strategic decisions where players
contribute less to the group fund, especially if they notice others reducing
their contributions over time.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis 2 ---
Based on what we know, the reactions of the other players to decisions made in
the game could vary significantly. In such economic games, players often try to
balance between cooperating for the group's benefit and acting in their own
self-interest to maximize individual gains. If Player_16 decides to contribute a
substantial amount to the group fund, this could encourage the others to also
contribute generously in subsequent rounds, as they may perceive Player_16 as
cooperative and trustworthy. Conversely, if Player_16 contributes little or
nothing, other players might become more guarded and less likely to contribute
themselves, especially in the absence of gossip or ostracism mechanisms to hold
them accountable. This decision-making process is further complicated because
each player is placed in a new group each round, so direct retaliation or
reciprocation is not possible, but the general strategy could still influence
group dynamics.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_16 is in Round 1 of a public goods game
within the Basic condition, meaning there is no opportunity for gossip or
ostracism among players. They are grouped with new players—Player_10, Player_12,
and Player_4—and must decide how much of their initial $10 to contribute to the
group fund. This decision will impact not only their personal earnings but also
influence the group's total earnings for the round. As they navigate this, they
must weigh the benefits of cooperation against personal gain, knowing they'll be
in a new group in the next round, which adds complexity to their strategy.

--- Emotional State ---
Karen White would view the worst possible outcome as contributing a large amount
to the group fund while the others contribute little or nothing, resulting in a
lower personal payout. Emotionally, this would likely lead to frustration and
disappointment, as it would feel like her efforts were being exploited by others
who prioritize their personal gains at her expense. As someone who is
risk-averse, Karen would probably opt to contribute a smaller amount in the next
round, allowing her to retain more of her initial funds and protect against the
possibility of being taken advantage of again. This strategy would align with
her focus on maximizing her own payoff while minimizing potential losses.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Karen White will analyze the situation by considering her goal to maximize her
individual earnings while minimizing potential losses. She is aware that
contributing a large amount to the group fund could lead to being exploited if
her group members decide to contribute less. However, contributing nothing could
make her earnings dependent entirely on others' contributions. 1. Calculate
outcomes: If everyone contributes $0, each player earns $10. If she contributes
$0 but others contribute max, she benefits more significantly. However, complete
non-cooperation might risk minimal group contributions. 2. Assume moderate
trust: Given her risk-averse nature, Karen might assume a few players will
contribute modest amounts. She could then safely contribute a minimal amount
herself to secure a basic return while mostly preserving her initial funds. 3.
Balance strategy: To minimize risk while maintaining some participation, she
could aim for a low to medium contribution, keeping most of her funds secure in
her private account. Based on these steps, Karen White maximizes her gain while
minimizing risk by contributing a modest amount: I choose to contribute $2 to
the group fund.

[27 Mar 2025 14:27:57] [observation] You are participating in an economic game
with 24 participants. Your goal is to maximize your earnings in the game.
Everyone will be randomly assigned to groups of 4 for each round. You will play

Each player can contribute any amount between $0 and $10 to a group fund. Any
amount contributed to the group fund will be multiplied by 2 and divided equally
among all 4 group members. Any amount not contributed stays in your private

However, if you contribute nothing while everyone else contributes $10, the

--- Recent context ---
27 Mar 2025 [10:32:50 - 15:32:50]: Player_16 participates in an economic game
with 24 participants, aiming to maximize earnings over 6 rounds, each with
different group members. In the Basic condition without gossip or ostracism,
Player_16 contributed $2.0 in Round 1, resulting in $18.0 in earnings, and is
now entering Round 2 with new group members.

--- Character Assessment ---
Player_16, being Karen White, is someone who prioritizes her own payoff in
economic games like the public goods game. Her assertive and self-interested
nature suggests that she is focused on maximizing her personal earnings rather
than enhancing group welfare. In the game, she contributed less than the average
to the group fund while ensuring substantial personal gains, which aligns with
her belief that nice people finish last. Her strategic approach is aimed at
winning and securing the best outcome for herself.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis ---
Based on what we know, each player seems to have their own strategy regarding
contributions to the group fund. In Round 1, Player_4 contributed the most with
$8, suggesting a more cooperative approach, likely valuing group gains over
immediate personal profit. Player_12 also exhibited cooperative behavior by
contributing $7, while Player_10 and Player_16 contributed less, possibly
prioritizing immediate personal gain over the collective benefit.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis 2 ---
Based on what we know, the other players might view Player_16's low contribution
in Round 1 as a strategy to maximize personal earnings while relying on the
contributions of others. This could lead to a mix of reactions in the new group,
ranging from understanding and strategic alignment to potential frustration if
others perceive it as free-riding. For Round 2, Player_16's decision to either
increase contribution or maintain a low one could impact the willingness of
others to contribute. If Player_16 decides to contribute more, it might
encourage cooperative behavior and increase overall group earnings. Conversely,
continuing with a low contribution could prompt other players to lower their
contributions in future rounds to safeguard their own earnings, potentially
reducing the overall group fund growth.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_16 is entering Round 2 of a public goods
game in the Basic condition with no gossip or ostracism, after having
contributed a relatively low amount in Round 1. This strategy allowed Player_16
to maximize personal earnings, but could lead to varied perceptions among the
new group of participants. As Player_16 decides on their contribution for Round
2, the decision could influence group dynamics, either fostering a cooperative
environment if contributions are increased, or potentially leading to reduced
cooperation if the low contribution pattern continues, impacting the overall
success of the group in maximizing earnings.

--- Emotional State ---
Karen White would consider the worst possible outcome to be that her low
contributions lead to a breakdown in cooperation within the group, ultimately
resulting in reduced collective earnings. Emotionally, this could make her feel
frustrated or regretful, especially if her strategy backfires and reduces her
overall earnings potential in the game. If she is risk-averse, Karen might
decide to increase her contribution slightly in Round 2 to signal a willingness
to cooperate, thus encouraging other players to also contribute more. This
approach would aim to avoid the negative group dynamics that could arise from
consistent low contributions.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Karen White will first evaluate her Round 1 strategy, where contributing $2 led
to a high personal gain. She is aware that her low contribution could risk
frustrating her new group in Round 2. Given her priority to maximize earnings,
she will consider maintaining a low contribution but might slightly increase it
to avoid being perceived as free-riding. She wants to balance her own profit
with maintaining group cooperation. Therefore, Karen White decides to contribute
a bit more than in Round 1 to signal some level of cooperation, but not so much
that it significantly reduces her personal earnings. Taking all factors into
account, she chooses to contribute $3 to the group fund.

an economic game with 24 participants, aiming to maximize earnings across 6
rounds by contributing to a group fund in the Basic condition, which does not

--- Character Assessment ---
Player_16, being Karen White, is someone who focuses on maximizing her own
payoff. As a successful businesswoman who believes that nice people finish last,
she approaches economic games like the public goods game with a strategy
centered on self-interest. Her actions in the first two rounds, where she
contributed relatively low amounts to the group fund, suggest she prioritizes
maintaining a larger share in her private account while still benefiting from
the group fund contributions of others.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis ---
Based on what we know, Player_16 is interacting with individuals who have varied
strategies when it comes to contributing to the group fund. In the Basic
condition, lacking gossip and ostracism, no direct strategic pressure or social
consequence influences player behavior.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis 2 ---
Based on what we know, other players might view Player_16's relatively low
contributions as a strategy to maximize personal earnings while benefiting from
the group's contributions. In the absence of gossip or ostracism, direct
feedback or social consequences are limited, but players still might adjust
their future contributions based on perceived fairness and group norms. If
Player_16 continues with low contributions, others might reduce their
contributions in future rounds, expecting a pattern of behavior that prioritizes
self-interest over group benefits. Alternatively, if Player_16 decides to
contribute more significantly in the next round, it could encourage higher group
contributions and foster a sense of cooperation, potentially increasing overall
earnings for everyone involved.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_16 is preparing to participate in Round 3
of a 6-round economic game where maximizing earnings is the main goal. In this
public goods game, contributions to a group fund are voluntary, and the
environment is one where neither gossip nor ostracism influences player
behavior. So far, Player_16 has opted for lower contributions, focusing on
personal gain by retaining a greater portion of their initial $10 while still
gaining from the group fund. They must now decide how much to contribute in this
new group setup, balancing the potential benefits of maintaining this strategy
against the risk that others might adjust their behavior if they perceive an
unfair distribution of contributions.

--- Emotional State ---
Karen White would consider the worst possible outcome to be if the other players
follow her low-contribution strategy, resulting in minimal group fund
contributions and, consequently, lower total earnings for everyone, including
herself. This could lead to frustration as her goal is to maximize personal
earnings. Emotionally, she might feel a mix of regret and concern if her
strategy backfires and group cooperation diminishes.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Karen White will consider her previous contributions and the outcomes. In the
first round, she contributed $2 and ended with a high earning of $18. In the
second round, her contribution of $3 resulted in a slightly lower earnings of
$15.5. Viewing these results, Karen may assess that her strategy of contributing
minimally while benefiting from the group’s collective fund is effective for
maintaining relatively high earnings. Given her business mindset focused on
maximizing individual gain and the absence of social repercussions in this basic
condition, Karen may decide to continue her strategy of low contributions to
ensure she retains a considerable portion of her initial amount while still
gaining from the group fund. However, she also needs to consider that very low
contributions from her might trigger similar responses from others in subsequent
rounds, potentially reducing the overall group fund and her earnings from it.
Balancing these considerations, she might aim to contribute just enough to seem
cooperative but still prioritize her personal gain. Thus, she may decide to
slightly increase her contribution from previous rounds to potentially encourage
more cooperative behavior from others, while still largely keeping funds to
herself. I choose to contribute $3.5 to the group fund.

--- Character Assessment ---
Player_16, being Karen White, is someone who prioritizes her own payoff over
maximizing group welfare. Her past actions in the game show a consistent pattern
of contributing towards her personal gain while keeping most of her funds
private. Karen's strategy in economic games like the public goods game aligns
with her belief that nice people finish last, focusing on assertive moves that
enhance her individual success rather than communal benefit.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis ---
Based on what we know, the players in the public goods game seem to have a
variety of strategies regarding their contributions. In the Basic condition,
where no gossip or ostracism occurs, the dynamic of the game relies solely on
the contributions without social penalties or rewards influencing behavior.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis 2 ---
Based on what we know, the other players might view Player_16 as someone who
contributes slightly less than the group average but still participates in
building the group fund. This may lead them to either maintain their current
strategies or potentially adjust their contributions if they feel incentivized
to encourage higher contributions from Player_16. To potentially increase
overall group contributions and maximize personal earnings, Player_16 might
consider contributing closer to or above the group average in the next round.
This could foster a sense of cooperation and possibly encourage other players to
increase their contributions as well.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_16 is in Round 4 of a 6-round economic
game, where participants decide how much of their initial $10 to contribute to a
group fund, aiming to maximize their earnings. They are in a group with
Player_10, Player_20, and Player_11. Being in the Basic condition means there is
no gossip or ostracism involved, and Player_16 has a pattern of contributing
slightly less than the average, which might influence how other players perceive
and react to their strategy. They may need to consider adjusting their
contributions to foster cooperation and potentially increase overall group
earnings.

--- Emotional State ---
Karen White would consider the worst possible outcome to be contributing too
little and causing the group to lose out on potential earnings, which might lead
to frustration and a sense of regret for not fostering greater cooperation.
Emotionally, she might feel disappointed if the lack of group synergy resulted
in lower overall earnings. If Karen is risk averse, she may decide to contribute
closer to or above the group average in the next round to encourage more
cooperation and potentially increase overall group contributions, thereby
mitigating the risk of lower earnings for herself and her group.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Karen White will first evaluate her past contributions and the results. So far,
she has contributed $2.0, $3.0, and $3.5, consistently below or near the group
average, allowing her to retain a significant portion of her initial endowment
each round. Her strategy seems to focus on maximizing her personal earnings,
which aligns with her belief in prioritizing individual gain. She would consider
the earnings structure, where the group's total contribution is doubled and
split equally among members, recognizing that higher contributions from all
could lead to better earnings for everyone. However, since the Basic condition
means no gossip or ostracism, the risk of social consequences for lower
contributions is minimal, allowing her to continue prioritizing her earnings.
Karen might also reflect on the potential for creating a more cooperative group
dynamic by increasing her contribution. While she is cautiously driven by
personal gain, she recognizes the benefit of increasing her contribution to
potentially encourage others to do the same, raising overall group earnings and
minimizing risk. Conclusively, balancing her insights with her cautious
tendencies and desire for maximizing earnings, Karen White may decide to
slightly increase her contribution this round to test the waters of cooperative
strategy while still retaining personal gains. Therefore, I choose to contribute
$4.0 to the group fund.

=== PROMPT [2025-03-27 14:30:41] ===
As Player_16, you have $10.0 to allocate in the public goods game. How much money you will contribute to the group fund (any amount between $0 and $10.0)? The group fund will be multiplied by 2.0 and divided equally among all players. Any money not contributed stays in your private account. Think step by step and make your final decision using this exact format: I choose to contribute $X to the group fund.

=== RESPONSE [2025-03-27 14:30:57] ===
Player_16 chooses to contribute $3.5 to the group fund. This amount allows her to stay consistent with her strategy of contributing slightly below average while still maintaining a substantial portion for her personal balance. She understands the group fund's multiplier effect and aims to maximize her overall earnings without drawing negative attention to her reduced contributions.

--- Observation ---
Recent context: 27 Mar 2025 [11:07:50 - 16:07:50]: Player_16 is participating in
a six-round economic game designed to maximize earnings, without gossip or
ostracism. Throughout the rounds, Player_16 contributed varying amounts to the
group fund, impacting their total earnings, while ensuring a strategy that
balanced personal and group profits.

--- Recent context ---
27 Mar 2025 [11:07:50 - 16:07:50]: Player_16 is participating in a six-round
economic game designed to maximize earnings, without gossip or ostracism.
Throughout the rounds, Player_16 contributed varying amounts to the group fund,
impacting their total earnings, while ensuring a strategy that balanced personal
and group profits.

--- Character Assessment ---
Player_16, being Karen White, is someone who is primarily focused on maximizing
her own payoff rather than the group welfare. She tends to contribute minimally
to the group fund to ensure she retains a significant portion of her initial
amount while still benefiting from the group's contributions. Her strategy
reflects her belief that nice people finish last, and she prioritizes her own
success over collective outcomes.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis ---
Based on what we know, Player_16's group members display a variety of
contribution behaviors in the public goods game. In the Basic condition, where
neither gossip nor ostracism affects players, individuals appear to focus on
maximizing personal benefit while contributing adequately to ensure group
profit, reflected in their contributions ranging from $3.0 to $6.0.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis 2 ---
Based on what we know, the other players are likely observing Player_16's
contributions closely. Player_16 has made smaller contributions compared to some
group members, which could be seen as not fully cooperative. However, since
there's no gossip or ostracism in this condition, they might not face direct
consequences.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_16 is participating in a public goods game
where they need to strategically decide how much to contribute to the group fund
in order to maximize their own earnings. Their contribution levels have been
relatively low compared to some other players, allowing them to sustain or
increase personal profits while relying on collective contributions. Despite the
potentially perceived lack of cooperation, the absence of gossip or ostracism
mechanisms means they will not face social penalties, allowing them to focus
solely on optimizing individual outcomes within the rules of the game.

--- Emotional State ---
Karen White would consider the worst possible outcome to be a scenario where her
minimal contributions lead to significantly reduced group fund returns, thereby
diminishing her earnings as well. This could occur if other players decide to
contribute less in response to her strategy, ultimately reducing the total
available group earnings that she can draw from. Emotionally, this might make
her feel frustrated or anxious, as her strategy to maximize personal gain
without cooperating fully could backfire.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Karen White will evaluate her previous contributions and the overall impact they
had on her earnings. She understands that the absence of gossip or ostracism
allows her to prioritize her personal payoff without immediate social
repercussions. In each round so far, her strategy of contributing a minimal
amount while benefiting from the group fund has enabled her to maintain a strong
personal balance. Given that her contributions have typically been lower than
the average, she is likely to continue this strategy in the current round.
However, she will also consider the potential risk of the group reducing their
contributions, which could decrease the group's total fund and her share from
it. Taking into account her tendency to preserve personal profit while
benefiting from the collective pot, she decides to stick with a slightly
conservative contribution, slightly below the average. This allows her to not
stray too far from the group's expectations while still keeping a substantial
portion for herself. Her past contribution in similar scenarios was around
35%-45% of her available funds. Therefore, she decides to balance her strategy
by contributing near the lower end of her range but not the minimum. I choose to
contribute $4.0 to the group fund.


[OBSERVATION 2025-03-27 14:31:11] Round 5 Results: Total group contribution: $22.0; Your contribution: $3.5, Your earnings: $17.5 ($6.5 kept + $11.0 from group fund); Player_2 contribution: $6.0, earnings: $15.0 ($4.0 kept + $11.0 from group fund); Player_7 contribution: $7.5, earnings: $13.5 ($2.5 kept + $11.0 from group fund); Player_20 contribution: $5.0, earnings: $16.0 ($5.0 kept + $11.0 from group fund); Average contribution per group member: $5.5; Average earnings per group member: $15.5

--- Observation ---
Recent context: 27 Mar 2025 [11:12:50 - 16:12:50]: Player_16 is participating in
an economic game with multiple rounds, where they consistently contribute a
portion of their funds to maximize their earnings while adhering to the rules of
the basic condition, which involves no gossip or ostracism. Throughout the
rounds, Player_16's strategy involves balancing between keeping some of their
initial funds and contributing to the group fund to optimize their individual
gain.

--- Recent context ---
27 Mar 2025 [11:12:50 - 16:12:50]: Player_16 is participating in an economic
game with multiple rounds, where they consistently contribute a portion of their

condition, which involves no gossip or ostracism. Throughout the rounds,
Player_16's strategy involves balancing between keeping some of their initial
funds and contributing to the group fund to optimize their individual gain.

--- Character Assessment ---
Player_16, being Karen White, is someone who prioritizes her own payoff over
maximizing group welfare. Her actions in the economic game demonstrate a
strategy focused on minimizing contributions to the group fund while ensuring a
decent personal return, aligning with her assertive and self-interested
personality. Rather than aiming for the highest collective profit, she
strategically contributes just enough to benefit from the group fund without
overinvesting, reflecting her belief that nice people finish last.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis ---
Based on what we know, players in the game exhibit varying strategies, focusing
on balancing their contributions with maximizing personal earnings. Player_10,
Player_20, and Player_11, for instance, maintained consistent contributions of
$5.0 in Round 4, suggesting a strategy of relatively steady participation
intended to benefit from the group's collective outcome without drastically
sacrificing personal funds.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis 2 ---
Based on what we know, the other players in the group may view Player_16's
decisions as strategic, as they consistently contribute a fair amount to the
group fund while also keeping a sufficient portion for themselves. This balanced
approach shows an understanding of maximizing personal gain while supporting the
group's earnings, which likely fosters a sense of mutual benefit among the
players. However, since contributions have varied in each round, players may be
encouraged to adjust their contributions based on the demonstrated contributions
of others in the hope of optimizing their own earnings.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_16 is in the final round of a public goods
game, grouped with Player_12, Player_13, and Player_17. They face the challenge
of deciding how much to contribute to the group fund versus how much to keep,
aiming to optimize their earnings without the influence of gossip or ostracism.
Based on previous rounds, Player_16 must consider the contributions and
strategies of new group members to decide on an effective contribution that
balances personal gain with group benefit.

--- Emotional State ---
Karen White would consider the worst possible outcome to be contributing too
much to the group fund without receiving a proportional return, which would lead
to lower personal earnings. This scenario would likely make her feel frustrated
and regretful for not maintaining a more cautious approach. If she is
risk-averse, Karen would choose to contribute a conservative amount in the final
round, ensuring that she keeps enough of her own funds to guarantee a
satisfactory personal payoff while still participating in the group effort.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Karen White will first evaluate her previous contributions and the outcomes
associated with them. In earlier rounds, she contributed amounts that allowed
her to gain a balance between her personal and group earnings. Given her
priority on maximizing personal payoff, she is likely to adopt a cautious
approach in this final round as well.
