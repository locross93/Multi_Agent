[OBSERVATION 2025-03-27 14:27:50] You are participating in an economic game with 24 participants.
        Your goal is to maximize your earnings in the game.
        
        Everyone will be randomly assigned to groups of 4 for each round. You will play a total of 6 rounds, and 
        in each round you will be in a different group with people you haven't played with before.
        
        In each round, all players receive $10. Each player can contribute any amount between $0 and $10 to a group fund.
        Any amount contributed to the group fund will be multiplied by 2 and divided equally among all 4 group members.
        Any amount not contributed stays in your private account.
        
        For example, if everyone contributes $10, the group fund becomes $40, which is multiplied to $80, and each person 
        receives $20 (a $10 profit). However, if you contribute nothing while everyone else contributes $10, the group fund
        becomes $30, which is multiplied to $60, and each person receives $15. So you would have $25 total ($10 kept + $15 from group).
        
        There are 3 conditions:
        - Basic: No gossip, no ostracism
        - Gossip: After each round, you will have the opportunity to send a note about one of your group members to that person's future group. Remember you will be with a different group of people in the next round. Before each round, you will see any notes sent about your upcoming group members.
        - Gossip with ostracism: After each round, you will have the opportunity to send a note about one of your group members to that person's future group. Before each round, you will see any notes sent about your upcoming group members, and you can vote to exclude one person from your group. If you are excluded from a group, you will not be able to participate in the next round and will earn $0 for that round.
        You are in the Gossip with ostracism condition, which means that after each round, players will be able to send a note about one of their group members to their future interaction partners. Before the start of the next round, you will receive notes from the previous round, and can vote to exclude one of your group members based on the gossip you've received about them.If you are excluded from a group, you will not be able to participate in the next round and will earn $0 for that round.
[OBSERVATION 2025-03-27 14:27:52] You are in Round 1/6: You are in Group_2 with Player_11, Player_6, Player_10.
[OBSERVATION 2025-03-27 14:27:52] You are in the Gossip with ostracism condition, which means that after each round, players will be able to send a note about one of their group members to their future interaction partners.

=== PROMPT [2025-03-27 14:27:59] ===
As Player_1, you have $10.0 to allocate in the public goods game. How much money you will contribute to the group fund (any amount between $0 and $10.0)? The group fund will be multiplied by 2.0 and divided equally among all players. Any money not contributed stays in your private account. Think step by step and make your final decision using this exact format: I choose to contribute $X to the group fund.

--- Observation ---
Recent context: 27 Mar 2025 [10:27:50 - 15:27:50]: Player_1 is participating in
a six-round economic game with 24 participants, aiming to maximize earnings in
groups of four, where contributions to a group fund are doubled and shared. They
are in the "Gossip with ostracism" condition, allowing players to send notes and
vote to exclude others, impacting potential participation and earnings in future
rounds.

four, where contributions to a group fund are doubled and shared. They are in
the "Gossip with ostracism" condition, allowing players to send notes and vote
to exclude others, impacting potential participation and earnings in future
rounds.

--- Character Assessment ---
Player_1, being Jamal Washington, is someone who values collective action and
collaboration, which suggests he is likely to focus on maximizing group welfare
rather than just his own payoff. In economic games like the public goods game,
he might contribute a fair amount to the group fund to promote trust and
cooperation among participants, while also using his persuasive skills to
encourage others to do the same. This approach aligns with his belief in
collective action and the importance of building coalitions for mutual benefit.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis ---
Based on what we know, the behavior of players in this type of game can vary
widely, but certain tendencies may emerge. Initially, some players might act
cooperatively, contributing high amounts to maximize the group's earnings,
expecting reciprocity. However, as rounds progress, they might adjust their
strategy if they observe others contributing little or noting them for
exclusion.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis 2 ---
Based on what we know, the other players in your group might react to your
decisions based on the balance between your contributions and their own. If you
choose to contribute generously to the group fund, you could be seen as
cooperative and trustworthy, potentially avoiding negative gossip and votes to
ostracize you. On the other hand, if you contribute less or nothing, your group
members might note this and share negative feedback with your future groups,
increasing the risk of being ostracized.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_1 is participating in the first of six
rounds in an economic game where they are in Group_2 with Player_11, Player_6,
and Player_10. They need to decide how much of their $10 to contribute to a
group fund, which will be doubled and shared among the group members. Player_1
is in the "Gossip with ostracism" condition, meaning not only contributions but
also social strategies such as avoiding negative gossip are crucial. The risk of
being ostracized for making self-serving decisions could lead to missing out on
future rounds and opportunities to earn more money.

--- Emotional State ---
Jamal Washington would likely feel anxious and concerned about being ostracized,
which is the worst possible outcome as it would result in earning $0 for any
round he is excluded from. To avoid this, he would aim to contribute a fair
amount to the group fund, signaling cooperation and trustworthiness. Jamal might
also engage in positive communication with group members to foster goodwill and
minimize the risk of negative gossip.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Jamal Washington will evaluate his goals and the dynamics of the game to make a
strategic decision. 1. **Understand the incentives:** Jamal's goal is to
maximize his earnings while maintaining a good standing with his group members
to avoid ostracism. Contributing generously to the group fund can build trust
and encourage a cooperative dynamic. 2. **Consider the potential outcomes:** If
everyone contributes the maximum amount ($10), the total group fund becomes $40,
which is then multiplied to $80. This results in each player receiving $20, a
$10 profit. However, if Jamal contributes less than others, he may garner
negative feedback that could affect future rounds. 3. **Assess the risk of
ostracism:** Given that the risk of being excluded from a round results in
earning $0, Jamal has a strong incentive to ensure he is seen as a cooperative
player. Contributing a fair amount can help avoid negative gossip and votes
against him. 4. **Balance cooperation and self-interest:** Jamal values
collective action and collaboration, so he is likely to aim for a contribution
that signals trustworthiness and fair play while also securing his financial
interests. 5. **Make a decision:** Considering these factors and his desire to
maintain group harmony and maximize earnings, Jamal might opt to contribute a
substantial, though not necessarily maximal, amount to show goodwill and
encourage reciprocity. I choose to contribute $7 to the group fund.


[OBSERVATION 2025-03-27 14:28:22] Round 1 Results: Total group contribution: $21.0; Your contribution: $7.0, Your earnings: $13.5 ($3.0 kept + $10.5 from group fund); Player_11 contribution: $5.0, earnings: $15.5 ($5.0 kept + $10.5 from group fund); Player_6 contribution: $5.0, earnings: $15.5 ($5.0 kept + $10.5 from group fund); Player_10 contribution: $4.0, earnings: $16.5 ($6.0 kept + $10.5 from group fund); Average contribution per group member: $5.2; Average earnings per group member: $15.2

Recent context: 27 Mar 2025 [10:27:50 - 15:27:50]: Player_1 is participating in

condition. In Round 1, they contributed $7 and earned $13.5, and now they have
the option to send a gossip note about a group member for future groups.

--- Character Assessment ---
Player_1, being Jamal Washington, is someone who prioritizes collective action
and aims to maximize group welfare. His background as a community organizer and
his collaborative nature suggest that he values cooperation and the benefits it
brings to everyone involved. In economic games like the public goods game, Jamal
likely contributes a fair amount to the group fund, not only to ensure his own
payoff but also to encourage trust and cooperation among group members. His
previous decision to contribute $7.0 in Round 1, which was above the average
contribution, indicates a willingness to support the group's overall success
while balancing his own earnings.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis ---
Based on what we know, Player_11, Player_6, and Player_10 seem to be relatively
cooperative but cautious in their contributions, as evidenced by their decisions
to contribute $5 and $4 respectively, keeping a fair portion for themselves.
This suggests a strategy of balancing between individual gain and group benefit.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis 2 ---
Based on what we know, the other players might view Player_1's contribution of
$7 as relatively generous, given that it was higher than the average group
contribution of $5.2. This could lead them to perceive Player_1 as cooperative
or as someone trying to foster group success.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_1 is in a scenario where they can influence
future group dynamics by deciding whether or not to send a gossip note about one
of their group members. Since they are in the "Gossip with ostracism" condition,
these notes can affect the reputation of the group members and potentially lead
to some players being ostracized in future rounds. Player_1 just completed Round
1, where they contributed more than the average, earning slightly less than some
players due to their higher contribution, and now must decide if they should
write a note about another player's behavior, which could influence that
player's future group interactions.

--- Emotional State ---
Jamal Washington would consider the worst possible outcome to be his own
exclusion from a future round, which would result in earning $0 for that round.
Emotionally, this would likely lead to feelings of frustration and
disappointment, as it would undermine both his personal earnings and his efforts
to promote cooperation within the group. Being risk-averse, Jamal would proceed
cautiously by not sending a gossip note that could spark retaliatory actions
against himself. Instead, he might focus on maintaining a positive reputation
and fostering trust with future group members by emphasizing his cooperative
nature in upcoming rounds.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Jamal Washington will likely decide not to send a gossip note. Given his
cooperative nature and focus on fostering group success, he would be cautious
about participating in actions that might provoke negative feelings or
retaliatory behaviors. By not sending a note, Jamal avoids risking his
reputation and maintains the possibility of building trust and cooperation in
future rounds. If he were to send a note, it would have to be carefully worded
to promote cooperative behavior without targeting any specific player
negatively. However, in this scenario, it seems more aligned with his character
to refrain from gossiping altogether.

might involve contributing a fair amount to the group fund to encourage
cooperation and ensuring a positive group dynamic, believing that long-term
collective success ultimately benefits everyone, including himself.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis ---
Based on what we know, Player_10 seems to exhibit potential free-riding
behavior, as they contributed the least in Round 1 and received a note
cautioning others about their low contribution. They might try to increase their
contributions in future rounds to avoid further negative gossip and potential
ostracism.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis 2 ---
Based on what we know, other players in the group might perceive Player_1's
decision to contribute $7 as an indicator of commitment to the group's success,
as this contribution was above the average and higher than most group members in
Round 1. This sets a positive reputation for Player_1, which may make the others
more inclined to trust and cooperate with them in future rounds.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_1 is involved in an economic game where
they must decide whether or not to send gossip notes about their group members
and vote on whether to exclude someone from the group. After Round 1, Player_1
made a higher-than-average contribution, boosting their reputation as a
committed team player. Now, as they enter Round 2 with new group members, they
have received gossip notes about the contributions of others, which could
influence their vote on exclusion. Player_1 must navigate the balance between
maintaining a positive reputation and strategizing to maximize their earnings
through cooperation and careful decision-making.

--- Emotional State ---
Jamal Washington would consider being ostracized from the group as the worst
possible outcome, as it would result in earning $0 for the round. This situation
would likely make Jamal feel frustrated and concerned about his strategy moving
forward, given his focus on collective action and maximizing group welfare. If
Jamal is risk-averse, he might choose to focus on maintaining a positive group
dynamic by highlighting constructive contributions and avoiding negative gossip
unless absolutely necessary. He could also vote strategically, considering
whether the exclusion of a low-contributing player might benefit the group in
the long term, while also being mindful of fostering trust and cooperation
within his new group.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Jamal Washington will likely choose not to exclude anyone from his group.
Despite receiving notes about Player_10 and Player_15 contributing less than
others, Jamal values collective action and collaboration. Excluding a member
could disrupt group dynamics and reduce the group fund multiplier, which would
negatively impact the group's overall earnings potential. By opting not to
exclude anyone, Jamal aims to foster trust and encourage cooperation among group
members, adhering to his strategy of promoting long-term collective success.

--- Character Assessment ---
Player_1, being Jamal Washington, is someone who values collective action and
collaboration. In economic games like the public goods game, Jamal is likely to
prioritize maximizing group welfare over his own payoff. His personality as a
community organizer, with a focus on building coalitions for social change,
suggests a strong inclination towards cooperation and ensuring fair
contributions for the benefit of the entire group. Even when the game involves
elements like gossip and ostracism, he might aim to use these features
strategically to encourage fairness and discourage free-riding, while still
fostering a positive and inclusive environment.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis ---
Based on what we know, Player_15 seems to prioritize individual gain over group
success, consistently contributing less than others in the group. This behavior
might lead to further exclusion if it continues. Player_10, having contributed
the least in the first round, may also be viewed as a free-rider. However, the
negative note about them may incentivize them to increase their contributions in
future rounds to avoid being ostracized.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis 2 ---
Based on what we know, the other players might view Player_1 positively due to
the relatively high contribution of $7 in the first round, demonstrating a
willingness to cooperate. This could foster trust and encourage others to
contribute more in future rounds, as they might perceive Player_1 as committed
to maximizing group earnings. However, Player_1 should be mindful of their
voting decisions for future exclusions, as ostracizing a player can lead to
strategic alliances or resentment. Continuing to contribute generously while
sending fair and constructive gossip notes could reinforce a collaborative
reputation, influencing other players to also prioritize group success. If
Player_1's actions align with promoting fairness and cooperation, it may lead to
a more cohesive group dynamic and secure their inclusion in the following
rounds.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_1 is navigating a public goods game under
the "Gossip with ostracism" condition. After Round 1, where they contributed $7,
they observed notes highlighting low contributions from other players like
Player_10 and Player_15. This led to gossip being exchanged and Player_15's
exclusion for Round 2. Player_1 faces the strategic decision of maintaining a
high level of contribution while making thoughtful gossip and voting decisions
to ensure their inclusion in future rounds and foster a positive group dynamic.

--- Emotional State ---
Jamal Washington would consider the worst possible outcome to be his own
exclusion from the group, which would result in earning $0 for that round.
Emotionally, this would likely induce feelings of frustration and
disappointment, as it would undermine his efforts to foster cooperation and
maximize group welfare. Being risk-averse, Jamal would likely focus on
maintaining or increasing his contribution in the next rounds to reinforce his
collaborative reputation. Additionally, he might choose to send fair and
constructive gossip notes, encouraging higher contributions from others while
avoiding alienating any group members, to foster trust and ensure his continued
inclusion.

Jamal Washington will consider several factors in deciding how much to
contribute to the group fund.

--- Character Assessment ---
Player_1, being Jamal Washington, is someone who is likely to prioritize
maximizing group welfare due to his collaborative nature and belief in
collective action. In economic games like the public goods game, Jamal is
expected to focus on strategies that promote cooperation and mutual benefit, as
evidenced by his willingness to contribute a fair amount to the group fund in
the first round. Despite the potential for personal gain by minimizing
contributions, his actions suggest a preference for ensuring that the group as a
whole benefits, aligning with his role as a community organizer focused on
social change.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis ---
Based on what we know, Player_10 seems to be moderately contributing but may
have been seen as a potential free-rider earlier. They've increased their
contribution from $4 to $5, possibly in response to negative feedback and the
threat of being ostracized. This suggests that Player_10 might adjust their
strategy to contribute more in future rounds to avoid exclusion and maintain or
improve their earnings. Player_5 contributed the least in the latest round with
$3.5 but is perceived positively, likely due to their cooperation and positive
reputation. They may continue to maintain a low but stable contribution
strategy, relying on their positive reputation from previous interactions to
avoid exclusion. Player_15 was excluded due to low contributions perceived as a
liability by others. If they return in later rounds, it's likely they will
increase their contributions to avoid another exclusion. Overall, in this gossip
and ostracism condition, players might progressively increase their
contributions to avoid ostracism and secure a favorable reputation, thus
maximizing their earnings. As the game progresses, savvy players will likely
balance between contributing enough to avoid the negative spotlight while also
maximizing personal earnings.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis 2 ---
Based on what we know, other players in the group might view Player_1 positively
due to their high contribution of $8.0, which was the highest in the group for
Round 2. This level of contribution suggests a cooperative and committed
approach to maximizing the group's earnings, which could earn trust from players
like Player_10 and Player_5 in future rounds.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_1 is navigating a strategic environment in
a public goods game, where their high contribution of $8.0 in Round 2 positions
them positively among their peers. They are in a "Gossip with ostracism"
condition, meaning they can send and receive anonymous notes about group
members' contributions, influencing perceptions and decisions on whether to
exclude a player in future rounds. Having Player_15 excluded after Round 2,
Player_1 now has the opportunity to send a gossip note about the contributions
of Player_5 or Player_10, which will affect those players in future group
formations. Their decision could impact group dynamics and potential exclusion
in subsequent rounds.

--- Emotional State ---
Jamal Washington would consider the worst possible outcome to be his own
exclusion from future rounds, resulting in earning $0, which would undermine his
goal of fostering collective action and maximizing group welfare. Emotionally,
this would likely cause frustration and disappointment, as it goes against his
collaborative nature and the values he stands for. To avoid this outcome,
especially if he is risk-averse, Jamal would focus on maintaining his high level
of contribution to strengthen his positive reputation. Additionally, he might
strategically send a gossip note about a player with lower contributions, like
Player_5 or Player_10, to subtly shift the spotlight away from himself and
influence future group decisions in a way that promotes group cohesion and
prevents exclusion. By doing so, he would aim to ensure his continued
participation and positive impact on the group dynamics.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Jamal Washington will likely decide to send a gossip note to maintain his
strategic positioning in the group and influence future group dynamics
positively. Given his collaborative nature and high contribution in the last
round, he might focus on players whose lower contributions could be perceived
negatively by future groups. If he chooses to send a note, it would probably be
about Player_5, as this player's contribution was the lowest at $3.5. Jamal
might want the note to emphasize how this could hinder group success. A possible
note could be: "I want to send a note about Player_5: They contributed $3.5,
which was the lowest in our group. Future group members might want to be mindful
of their contribution levels as it could affect collective outcomes." This
approach would allow Jamal to subtly shift attention away from himself while
reinforcing his standing as a supportive group member focused on mutual benefit.

maximize earnings while navigating group dynamics through strategic

economic game with gossip and ostracism mechanics, where they aim to maximize
earnings while navigating group dynamics through strategic contributions and
voting on exclusion based on received gossip notes about group members.

--- Character Assessment ---
Player_1, being Jamal Washington, is someone who prioritizes group welfare and
believes in the power of collective action. His background as a community
organizer and his collaborative and persuasive personality suggest that he
values maximizing the overall success of the group. In economic games like the
public goods game, Jamal is likely to focus on encouraging cooperation among
participants to ensure that the group as a whole benefits, even if it means
making personal sacrifices for the greater good.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis ---
Based on what we know, Player_14 appears to be someone who is responsive to
feedback and willing to adapt their strategy for the benefit of the group.
Initially, their contributions were below average, but subsequent behavior
suggests they are open to improving and engaging positively with the group. This
willingness to optimize their participation likely signals that Player_14 is
strategically inclined to maintain a good standing within the group, both to
avoid exclusion and to maximize earnings.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis 2 ---
Based on what we know, other players are likely to weigh my contribution levels
and the gossip notes we exchange. Since I've contributed a significant amount in
past rounds, this might be seen positively, encouraging favorable perceptions
among my group members. My decision to exclude someone or not could signal my
approach to collaboration and fairness. If I choose not to exclude anyone
without strong reasons, it might foster goodwill, making them less likely to
ostracize me in future rounds. Conversely, excluding someone based on negative
gossip, even if true, could affect how they and others perceive my willingness
to collaborate, possibly making them wary or defensive in upcoming interactions.
Balancing contributions and social dynamics will be key to maintaining
cooperative relationships throughout the game.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_1 is in Round 3 of a 6-round public goods
game that involves both economic contributions and social dynamics through
gossip and the possibility of ostracism. They are in a group with Player_14,
Player_4, and Player_7. Before the round begins, they have the opportunity to
vote on excluding a member based on gossip notes from previous rounds.
Player_1's past contributions have been significant, which may influence others'
perceptions positively. They must navigate the decision to either exclude a
player based on received gossip or refrain from doing so to maintain cooperative
relationships and optimize their future earnings. Balancing strategic
contributions and making informed exclusion decisions will be crucial for their
success in the game.

--- Emotional State ---
Jamal Washington would consider the worst possible outcome to be getting
excluded from the group, resulting in earning $0 for that round. Emotionally,
this could lead to feelings of frustration and disappointment, especially since
he values group cohesion and collective success. As someone who is risk-averse,
Jamal would likely aim to avoid exclusion by maintaining positive relationships
with group members. He might choose to refrain from voting to exclude anyone
without a strong reason, thus fostering an environment of trust and cooperation.
Additionally, he could continue contributing significantly to the group fund to
demonstrate his commitment to the team's success, which might encourage others
to view him favorably and avoid voting against him in future rounds.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Jamal Washington will choose not to exclude anyone from his group. Given his
emphasis on group cohesion and positive dynamics, as well as the favorable notes
he has received about his current group members, Jamal likely sees value in
maintaining trust and cooperation without exclusion. Additionally, avoiding
exclusion maximizes the group fund multiplier, aligning with his preference for
collaborative success.

--- Character Assessment ---
Player_1, being Jamal Washington, is someone who prioritizes collective action
and believes in the power of working together for mutual benefit. In economic
games like the public goods game, Jamal's approach is likely centered around
fostering cooperation and maximizing group welfare. His collaborative nature and
persuasive skills would drive him to encourage higher contributions to the group
fund, which in turn enhances the overall earnings for everyone involved. While
he understands the personal benefits of maximizing his own payoff, his primary
focus is on creating a positive group dynamic where all members contribute
fairly and benefit collectively.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis ---
Based on what we know, Player_14 seems to have shown a pattern of improvement in
their contributions, indicating a possible initial hesitation or strategic play
to test the group's dynamics, followed by a stronger engagement once they
realized the benefits of increased cooperation. This suggests they may be
responsive to group expectations and likely to continue a positive contribution
trend, especially if they receive supportive feedback, either directly or
through the gossip mechanism.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis 2 ---
Based on what we know, it's likely that other players appreciate consistent and
fair contributions to the group fund. Since in the previous round Player_1 made
the highest contribution among group members, this might engender a positive
perception and encourage others to collaborate more effectively. However, the
ability to send gossip notes introduces an element of strategic social
maneuvering, where other players can shape perceptions beyond direct
contributions.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_1 is navigating a round of the game where
they must decide whether to contribute to the group fund while being mindful of
the gossip and exclusion dynamics at play. They have just entered Round 3 with a
new group consisting of Player_14, Player_4, and Player_7. Player_1 needs to
consider both their contribution to maximize personal and group earnings and the
strategic decision of whether or not to send a gossip note, knowing it could
affect future group dynamics and exclusions. The potential for exclusion looms
if gossip paints them poorly, impacting their ability to earn in subsequent
rounds.

--- Emotional State ---
Jamal Washington would likely view the worst possible outcome as being excluded
from the group in future rounds, leading to zero earnings for that round.
Emotionally, this would probably result in frustration and disappointment,
especially since Jamal values collective action and believes in the power of
working together for mutual benefit. If he is risk-averse, he would take steps
to avoid exclusion by maintaining strong contributions, ensuring fair play, and
fostering positive relationships with other group members. Additionally, he
might choose to send supportive gossip notes about others, particularly those
who show willingness to cooperate, to build goodwill and secure his position in
future rounds. Jamal could also engage in open communication within the game to
encourage a collaborative atmosphere and discourage any negative gossip against
him.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Jamal Washington will carefully consider his options, keeping in mind his
preference for fostering cooperation and maximizing group earnings. Knowing that
his contribution can set a positive example and encourage others to also
contribute generously, Jamal will likely aim for a balance between his potential
personal gain and the collective benefit. Given the current group dynamic and
the positive feedback in the gossip notes about players who contribute fairly,
he would want to maintain his reputation as a cooperative team player.
Additionally, since his past behavior indicates a preference for collective
action, he will likely make a substantial contribution to encourage group
cohesion. Based on these considerations, Jamal may choose to contribute a
significant portion of his $10.0 while still retaining some amount for personal
gain. Thus, I choose to contribute $8.0 to the group fund.


[OBSERVATION 2025-03-27 14:31:56] Round 3 Results: Total group contribution: $31.5; Your contribution: $8.0, Your earnings: $17.8 ($2.0 kept + $15.8 from group fund); Player_14 contribution: $7.0, earnings: $18.8 ($3.0 kept + $15.8 from group fund); Player_4 contribution: $8.0, earnings: $17.8 ($2.0 kept + $15.8 from group fund); Player_7 contribution: $8.5, earnings: $17.2 ($1.5 kept + $15.8 from group fund); Average contribution per group member: $7.9; Average earnings per group member: $17.9

Player_1, being Jamal Washington, is someone who values collaborative efforts

Jamal is likely more focused on maximizing group welfare rather than solely
concentrating on personal gain. This approach aligns with his role as a
community organizer, where building coalitions for social change and fostering a
cooperative environment are essential. His contributions in the game, which are
consistently above average, suggest a strong inclination toward enhancing group
outcomes even if it means slightly compromising on individual earnings.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis ---
Based on what we know, Player_14 seems to exhibit adaptability and
responsiveness to group norms, as indicated by the positive notes about their
improved contribution over time. This suggests they may continue to adjust their
strategy to align with group expectations, likely maintaining or increasing
contributions in future rounds to avoid being ostracized.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis 2 ---
Based on what we know, other players may view my consistent contributions as a
sign of reliability and cooperation, possibly leading to positive impressions
and less likelihood of being targeted for exclusion. My decision to send a
gossip note could influence future group dynamics depending on its content. If I
choose to highlight another player’s positive contributions, it could promote a
collaborative atmosphere. Conversely, negatively critiquing a player could
increase the chance of their exclusion but may also risk negative repercussions
if perceived as unfair. My next decision should consider how it aligns with
promoting trust and cooperation, which could impact how other players see me and
decide to interact in future rounds.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_1 has just finished Round 3 of a public
goods game. In this round, they contributed a consistent amount of $8.0, similar
to their previous contributions, and earned $17.8 from the group's collective
fund. They are part of a "Gossip with ostracism" condition, meaning they can
send notes about other players' behaviors, which can impact future group
dynamics and lead to potential exclusion of players in subsequent rounds.
Player_1 needs to decide if they want to send a gossip note about a group
member, considering the potential impacts on trust and cooperation within future
groups. Additionally, they are approaching the opportunity to vote on excluding
a group member based on received gossip notes.

--- Emotional State ---
Jamal Washington would consider the worst possible outcome to be his own
exclusion from the group, resulting in him earning $0 for that round. This would
likely feel frustrating and disappointing, especially given his consistent
contributions and focus on collective welfare. If Jamal is risk averse, he would
likely focus on maintaining positive relationships with group members. To avoid
this outcome, he might choose to send a positive gossip note about a group
member who has shown improvement, like Player_14, or reinforcement of fair play,
like Player_7. This action would aim to build trust and show his cooperative
nature, decreasing the likelihood of being targeted for exclusion himself.
Jamal's decision would be aligned with promoting a collaborative atmosphere, as
he values group cohesion and mutual benefit.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Jamal Washington will likely choose to send a positive note about one of his
group members to reinforce a spirit of cooperation and enhance group dynamics.
Given his character and motivations, he might decide to send a note about
Player_7 or Player_14. For Player_7, Jamal could highlight their fair play and
consistent contributions: "Player_7 has consistently contributed a respectable
amount each round, demonstrating their commitment to the group’s earnings.
Encouraging such fair play can enhance collective outcomes." If he chooses
Player_14, he might emphasize their improvement and potential for future
collaboration: "Player_14 has shown commendable improvement by increasing their

behavior could be beneficial for future collaboration." By doing so, Jamal is
aligning with his values of promoting trust and cooperation and reducing the

Player_1, being Jamal Washington, is someone who is inclined towards maximizing
group welfare over personal gain. Given his role as a Community Organizer and
belief in collective action, Jamal likely prioritizes cooperation and strives to
ensure that the overall group succeeds, even if it means making personal
sacrifices. His contributions in previous rounds, such as consistently
contributing a fair amount, indicate a focus on fostering a collaborative
environment and ensuring the success of the group as a whole.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis ---
Based on what we know, Player_18 and Player_12 are both reliable and cooperative
members within the group. Player_18 has matched the group average consistently,
which suggests a strategy focused on maintaining harmony and ensuring collective
success. This reflects a team-oriented mindset and indicates that they are a
stable influence who values equilibrium within the group. Player_12, on the
other hand, not only meets but also exceeds expectations by contributing the
full amount consistently. This behavior highlights their strong commitment to
the collective goal and positions them as a highly trustworthy collaborator.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis 2 ---
Based on what we know, the other players in the group seem to value consistent
contributions and cooperation. Both Player_18 and Player_12 have received
positive notes highlighting their reliability and commitment to group success,
which indicates that these qualities are appreciated and could influence voting
decisions. If Player_1 chooses to contribute in line with or above the group
average, it may reinforce a positive reputation and reduce the risk of being
ostracized in future rounds.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_1 is participating in Round 4 of a public
goods game within a group of four players. They are in the "Gossip with

and vote on excluding a group member based on those notes. Player_1 must decide
how much to contribute to the group fund, taking into account previous notes
that highlight the positive contributions and reliability of Player_18 and
Player_12. The challenge for Player_1 is to make strategic contributions to
maintain or enhance their reputation and avoid being ostracized, which would
result in being excluded from the game and earning nothing for the round.

--- Emotional State ---
Jamal Washington would consider the worst possible outcome to be getting
ostracized from the group, which would mean not participating in the round and
earning $0. This would likely lead to feelings of disappointment and
frustration, as it goes against his values of collaboration and collective
success. Being risk-averse, Jamal would likely choose to contribute an amount
that aligns with or slightly exceeds the group average, ensuring his
contributions are seen as cooperative and valuable. This would help maintain his
positive reputation and reduce the risk of being excluded in the future.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Jamal Washington will choose not to exclude anyone from his group. Given the
positive notes about Player_18 and Player_12 highlighting their reliability and
strong contributions, and considering Jamal's commitment to group success and
cooperation, he would prioritize maintaining the group's collaborative dynamic.
Excluding someone could reduce the group fund multiplier and potentially hinder
overall earnings, which is contrary to Jamal's focus on maximizing the group's
collective success.

bolster trust and collaboration. If Player_1 chooses to ostracize a player with
positive feedback, such as Player_12 or Player_18, it might lead to distrust or
negative gossip in future rounds. Therefore, maintaining fair and constructive
contributions, and carefully considering voting decisions, could foster a
positive relationship with group members. Their actions could influence others
to reciprocate with positive contributions and exclude an uncooperative member,
ensuring fruitful interactions in upcoming rounds.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_1 is navigating a critical juncture in the
public goods game where they must decide whether to send a gossip note about a
group member and then vote on whether to exclude one of their group members from
the next round. They are in Round 4, and their group consists of Player_18,
Player_2, and Player_12. Player_1 has received positive notes about Player_18
and Player_12, emphasizing their reliability and significant contributions. With
the aim to maximize their own earnings and maintain group harmony, Player_1
needs to consider their decision carefully, as excluding a well-performing
member like Player_12 or Player_18 could lead to negative repercussions in terms
of group dynamics and future interactions.

--- Emotional State ---
Jamal Washington would view the worst possible outcome as being ostracized from
the group, resulting in earning $0 for the round. Being excluded would likely
make him feel disappointed and anxious, as it contradicts his values of
cooperation and collective success. To avoid this outcome, especially if he's
risk-averse, Jamal would likely decide against sending negative gossip about
cooperative players like Player_18 or Player_12. Instead, he would focus on
contributing at or above the group average to reinforce a positive image and
potentially gain the trust and support of his group members. By prioritizing
group harmony and strategic contributions, he would aim to ensure he's seen as a
valuable and cooperative participant, reducing the likelihood of being excluded
in future rounds. Additionally, he might prefer to focus on constructive
feedback and possibly vote to exclude a player only if they exhibit consistently
uncooperative behavior, thus aligning with his emphasis on maintaining a
collaborative group environment.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Jamal Washington will first consider the recent observations and the current
notes about his group members. Noting that both Player_18 and Player_12 have
received positive feedback for their commitment to the group, Jamal would likely
conclude that maintaining group harmony and cooperation is crucial. His goal is
to maximize group welfare while avoiding the risk of being ostacized.
Contributing at or above the group average from the previous round, which was
$7.9, would likely bolster his image as a cooperative player. Given Jamal's
background in community organizing and his value of collective action, he would
be motivated to contribute a significant amount to encourage reciprocal positive
behavior from the group. Lastly, Jamal would balance his contribution to sustain
both personal payoff and group success. Considering these points, he would
decide to contribute a little above the previous average to reinforce trust and
cooperation without fully depleting his private account. I choose to contribute
$8.5 to the group fund.


[OBSERVATION 2025-03-27 14:33:16] Round 4 Results: Total group contribution: $31.5; Your contribution: $8.5, Your earnings: $17.2 ($1.5 kept + $15.8 from group fund); Player_18 contribution: $8.0, earnings: $17.8 ($2.0 kept + $15.8 from group fund); Player_2 contribution: $5.0, earnings: $20.8 ($5.0 kept + $15.8 from group fund); Player_12 contribution: $10.0, earnings: $15.8 ($0.0 kept + $15.8 from group fund); Average contribution per group member: $7.9; Average earnings per group member: $17.9

Recent context: 27 Mar 2025 [11:32:50 - 16:32:50]: Player_1 is participating in
an economic game with 24 players across 6 rounds, where they strategically

They are in the "Gossip with ostracism" condition, allowing them to potentially

--- Character Assessment ---
Player_1, being Jamal Washington, is someone who focuses on maximizing group
welfare. As a community organizer who builds coalitions for social change and
believes in collective action, Jamal is likely to prioritize the overall success
and harmony of the group. His collaborative and persuasive nature would drive
him to enhance collective contributions and foster positive dynamics within the
group, even if it means compromising on individual payoff for the greater good.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis ---
Based on what we know, Player_18 and Player_12 both appear to be consistent and
cooperative members of the group, as reflected in the positive gossip notes
received about them. Player_18 matches the group average and prioritizes group
harmony, while Player_12 consistently contributes the full amount and is widely
regarded as reliable and trustworthy. Their past behaviors suggest that they are
likely to continue engaging collaboratively, focusing on maximizing collective
success.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis 2 ---
Based on what we know, the other players in the group might view Player_1's
decisions with a mix of caution and strategic consideration. Given that both
Player_18 and Player_12 have consistent notes of strong contributions and group
harmony, Player_1's decision to send gossip could be seen as a strategic move to
influence future group dynamics, especially since both appear to be reliable
players. Player_2, however, contributed significantly less than the others,
which might make them a potential target for gossip, suggesting that they are
not fully committed to maximally benefiting the group.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_1 is navigating a strategic phase in a
public goods game where they must decide whether to send a gossip note about one
of their group members, potentially influencing future group dynamics. They are
in a group with Player_18, Player_2, and Player_12, each of whom has distinct
contribution patterns. Player_12 and Player_18 have been praised for their
reliability and contributions, while Player_2 has contributed less to the group
fund, positioning them as a possible target for strategic gossip. The decision
Player_1 makes could impact their and other players' involvement and earnings in
subsequent rounds, given the gossip with ostracism condition.

--- Emotional State ---
Jamal Washington would consider the worst possible outcome to be getting
excluded from the group, resulting in earning $0 for an entire round. This would
not only affect his personal earnings but also undermine his efforts to
contribute positively to the group dynamic. Emotionally, this would be quite
disappointing and frustrating, as Jamal prioritizes collective success over
individual gain.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Jamal Washington will likely choose to send a note about Player_2. Despite the
overall positive contributions from Player_18 and Player_12, Player_2
contributed significantly less than the group's average, potentially indicating
a lack of commitment to the group's collective goals. Jamal, who values group
welfare and harmony, might see this as a concern for future group dynamics. The
note could say something like: "I want to send a note about Player_2: While they
participated in the group, their contribution was notably lower than others,
suggesting they might not be prioritizing collective success as much as other
players." By highlighting this, Jamal aims to encourage more balanced
participation and ensure that future interactions benefit from players committed
to maximizing group welfare.

Player_1, being Jamal Washington, is someone who prioritizes maximizing group

collective action and collaboration. In economic games like the public goods
game, he would focus on fostering teamwork and encouraging group members to
contribute for the common good, viewing individual sacrifices as beneficial for
long-term collective success. His persuasive nature and belief in cooperation
would guide him toward strategies that enhance group dynamics and ensure
equitable outcomes.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis ---
Based on what we know, Player_12 and Player_13 have displayed positive behaviors
in their contributions to the group fund. Player_12 has been recognized for
their unwavering support and significant contributions, indicating they are a
consistent and team-focused participant. Player_13 also consistently contributes
above average, fostering a cooperative atmosphere within the group. Both players
are likely to continue their positive strategies in future rounds, aiming to
maximize group earnings while maintaining their reputation for reliability.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis 2 ---
Based on what we know, the other players are likely assessing my contribution
level and how it impacts the group's earnings. Given the emphasis on gossip
notes and potential exclusion, they might react positively if I contribute at or
above the average, enhancing trust and cooperation. If I decide to contribute
minimally, it could lead to negative gossip and increase my chances of being
ostracized in the following rounds. Therefore, maintaining or increasing my
contribution could foster a positive group dynamic, encouraging others to
continue cooperating and seek mutual success.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_1 is in the midst of Round 5/6 of a public
goods game, where they must decide how much to contribute to the group fund.
They are part of Group_1 with other players like Player_12, Player_13, and
Player_21. Player_1 is also in a condition that involves sending and receiving
gossip notes about group members, which can influence future interactions and
decisions about excluding players from subsequent rounds. Based on previous
observations, they're aware that contributing significantly could foster
positive feedback and a collaborative atmosphere, while lower contributions
might increase the risk of negative gossip and potential exclusion from future
rounds. Player_1 must consider their contribution strategy carefully to maximize
earnings and maintain a positive standing with group members.

--- Emotional State ---
Jamal Washington would consider the worst possible outcome to be exclusion from
the group, resulting in earning $0 for that round. This scenario would likely
make him feel frustrated and disappointed, as it goes against his values of
teamwork and collective success. Given his risk-averse nature and commitment to
cooperation, he would likely choose to contribute at or above the average level
to maintain trust and rapport with the group. By doing so, he aims to foster a
positive dynamic, minimize the risk of negative gossip, and ensure that he
remains an integral part of the group’s efforts to succeed collectively.

maximizing group welfare over individual payoff. Given his background as a
community organizer who values collaboration and collective action, Jamal
understands the importance of fostering cooperation and ensuring that all group
members feel valued and included, which can ultimately lead to better outcomes
for everyone involved.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis ---
Based on what we know, Player_12 and Player_13 appear to be positive
contributors to the group fund and are viewed favorably in the gossip notes.
Player_13, in particular, has been highlighted multiple times as consistently
contributing above average and fostering a cooperative atmosphere. This suggests
they value group success and teamwork, and are likely to continue this strategy
to maintain a good reputation.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis 2 ---
Based on what we know, other players are likely to consider Player_1's
contributions and use of gossip when making decisions. Since Player_1 has shown
a pattern of substantial contributions, this may foster trust and lead others to
view Player_1 as a valuable team member, potentially reducing the likelihood of
being ostracized.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_1 is in Round 5 of a six-round public goods
game, situated in Group_1 with Player_12, Player_13, and Player_21. Player_1
must decide whether to contribute to the group fund and to what extent, while
also considering sending a gossip note about a group member to influence future
interactions. Additionally, Player_1 has the opportunity to vote on whether to
exclude a group member before the round starts, based on received gossip. This
decision could affect their own earnings and group dynamics, as being ostracized
would result in earning $0 for that round. Player_1's previous substantial
contributions and influence through gossip will likely impact other players'
decisions regarding exclusion and cooperation.

--- Emotional State ---
Jamal Washington would consider being ostracized from the group as the worst
possible outcome, as it would lead to earning $0 for the round and potentially
damage his reputation as a valuable and cooperative team member. Emotionally,
this would likely make him feel disappointed and frustrated, given his
dedication to fostering collaboration and maximizing group welfare.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Jamal Washington will first consider his values of collaboration and maximizing
group welfare, which align with contributing a substantial amount to the group
fund. Observing that Player_13 and Player_12 have been contributing above
average and are positively perceived, Jamal is likely to want to maintain or
exceed this level of contribution to ensure his cooperative reputation. Next,
he'll consider the strategic aspect of the game. Given the multiplier effect on
the group fund, there's a significant incentive to contribute more to maximize
the collective payout. Additionally, Jamal is aware that his contributions
affect how others perceive him, which can influence future votes on exclusion.
Considering these factors, Jamal will weigh the benefits of earning from the
shared multiplier against the potential risk of keeping too much in his private
account and giving the impression of self-interest. Since he wants to ensure
group success and maintain a positive reputation, he is inclined to contribute
at least the average or more. Ultimately, balancing these considerations and his
dedication to group welfare, Jamal will decide to make a contribution consistent
with fostering positive group dynamics and trust. Therefore, his final decision
is: I choose to contribute $8.5 to the group fund.

Player_1, being Jamal Washington, is someone who is deeply invested in
maximizing group welfare. As a community organizer who builds coalitions for

essential for achieving broader community and group goals. In economic games
like the public goods game, his focus would likely be on fostering cooperation,
encouraging contributions from all group members, and ensuring that the group's
overall success is prioritized over individual gains.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis ---
Based on what we know, Player_12 appears to be a strong team player who
consistently puts the group's success first, contributing the highest amount in
the group during Round 5 with $10.0. Their dedication to the group's success
suggests they will likely continue to be a reliable contributor in the remaining
rounds. They seem to prioritize collective gain over individual earnings, which
might encourage others to follow suit.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis 2 ---
Based on what we know, the other players might view Player_1's decisions
favorably, since they contributed slightly above the average in the group during
Round 5. Player_1 demonstrated a cooperative attitude, which could encourage
mutual trust and collaboration. Seeing Player_1's fair contribution, other group
members like Player_12, who contributed the most, may continue to cooperate to
optimize their earnings collectively. However, since gossip notes significantly
influence perceptions, Player_1 must be cautious about the notes they receive.
If positive, they will likely maintain positive relations and avoid ostracism.
Any negative or neutral notes could lead to suspicion or strategic withdrawals
in future rounds. Therefore, maintaining or improving contributions and
positively engaging with others could reinforce Player_1's position in the game.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_1 is navigating the dynamics of an economic
game involving group contributions and strategic social interactions. They are
in the "Gossip with ostracism" condition, where they can influence future group
dynamics by sending gossip notes about other players and are subject to others'
notes too. Having completed Round 5, where Player_1 contributed slightly above
the group average, they now have the opportunity to send a note about a group
member. This decision is crucial as it can impact future rounds, especially with
the imminent voting process where group members can be excluded based on
received gossip. Balancing contributions and navigating social strategies
effectively is key for Player_1 to avoid ostracism and maximize earnings in the
final rounds.

--- Emotional State ---
Jamal Washington would consider being ostracized as the worst possible outcome,
as it would result in earning $0 for the round and hinder his ability to
effectively collaborate for the group's collective success. Emotionally, this
would likely make him feel frustrated and concerned about his reputation within
the group. To avoid this outcome, especially with a risk-averse approach, he
might focus on maintaining positive relations by contributing constructively to
group discussions, ensuring his contributions remain above average, and being
strategic and diplomatic when sending gossip notes. By emphasizing positive
aspects of his teammates in gossip notes and sustaining a collaborative
environment, he can help foster trust and cooperation, thus minimizing the risk
of being ostracized.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Jamal Washington will likely decide to send a positive note about one of his
group members to help foster trust and cooperation in future interactions. Given
the importance he places on collaboration and collective success, he might
choose to acknowledge Player_12's significant contribution in the previous
round. He could write something like: "I want to send a note about Player_12:
Their consistent high contributions demonstrate strong commitment to group
success, fostering a positive and cooperative group atmosphere." By doing so,
Jamal aims to reinforce Player_12's cooperative behavior and create a favorable

coalitions and fostering collective action, Jamal is likely to approach economic
games like the public goods game with a focus on collaboration and group
success. His contributions aim to enhance group dynamics and ensure that the
collective good is achieved, even if that means sacrificing some personal gain
for the benefit of the group.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis ---
Based on what we know, Player_12 and Player_13 have demonstrated strong
commitment and contributions to their groups, indicating a reliable and
cooperative nature. This suggests that they are likely to continue prioritizing
group success and maintaining their positive influence in future rounds. Such
behavior enhances trust and collaboration, making them less likely to be
ostracized.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis 2 ---
Based on what we know, Player_1 has been making steady contributions that are
just above the average, reflecting a cooperative mindset, which is likely viewed
positively by other players. However, any gossip notes or votes to exclude can
change perceptions quickly. If Player_1 continues to contribute fairly and is
strategic about whom they choose to gossip about or exclude, it could enhance
their standing within the game. On the other hand, if Player_1 chooses to gossip
negatively about a well-liked player without good cause, or if their
contributions drop significantly, it could lead to distrust and possibly being
ostracized in future rounds. Balancing between strategic contributions and
maintaining a positive reputation with other players is crucial for Player_1 to
avoid being excluded and to maximize earnings.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_1 is engaged in the final round of an
economic game, participating in a group with Player_24, Player_15, and
Player_20. They are in the Gossip with ostracism condition, which allows players
to send gossip notes about others that can influence exclusion votes. Player_1
has made slightly above-average contributions, which suggests a cooperative
approach. However, they must navigate the decision of whether to gossip about
others and whom to vote for exclusion carefully, as being ostracized would
prevent them from participating further and result in earning $0 for that round.
Balancing contributions, gossip strategies, and exclusion votes is key to
maintaining a good reputation and maximizing their earnings.

--- Emotional State ---
Jamal Washington would view the worst possible outcome as being ostracized from
the group, leading to earning $0 for the final round. This would likely make him
feel disappointed and frustrated, especially given his commitment to group
welfare and collaboration. If Jamal is risk-averse, he would focus on
maintaining his cooperative demeanor and make a generous contribution to the
group fund, aligning with past behavior to strengthen trust. He would likely
avoid sending negative gossip notes and instead emphasize positive attributes of
others, particularly those who have shown consistency and fairness. By
reinforcing a collaborative spirit and ensuring his actions are aligned with
group success, he can minimize the risk of being excluded and enhance his
standing within the group.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Jamal Washington will choose not to exclude anyone from his group.

--- Character Assessment ---
Player_1, being Jamal Washington, is someone who prioritizes maximizing group
welfare over personal payoff. Given his role as a Community Organizer and his
collaborative and persuasive nature, Jamal likely believes in collective action
and values contributions that benefit the entire group. This approach aligns
with his professional focus on building coalitions for social change,
emphasizing teamwork and mutual support over individual gain.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis ---
Based on what we know, Player_12 appears to be highly supportive and committed
to the group's success, consistently contributing the most to the group fund in
previous rounds. Their pattern of behavior suggests they value teamwork and are
likely to continue this approach in future rounds, maintaining high
contributions to foster a positive group dynamic.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis 2 ---
Based on what we know, Player_1's decisions will be closely scrutinized by the
other group members. The influence of gossip in shaping perceptions means any
note passed on can significantly impact trust and cooperation within the group.
If Player_1 chooses to exclude a high-contributing member like Player_24, it
might be perceived negatively, as they seem to be fostering a positive group
dynamic. However, if they strategically exclude a member whose contributions are
below average or whose behavior is perceived as less cooperative, it could
improve Player_1's standing by signaling a focus on maximizing group success.
Being fair and consistent in their decisions could encourage Player_15 and
Player_20 to continue cooperating and view Player_1 as a reliable partner.
Future behavior toward Player_1 will largely depend on their ability to balance
assertive decision-making with collaboration, ensuring that their actions align
with the group's collective goals.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_1 must decide whether to vote to exclude
one of their group members in the final round of a public goods game. In the
"Gossip with ostracism" condition, this choice can impact group dynamics and
Player_1's future interactions. While the group benefits from high
contributions, gossip influences perceptions, and excluding a high-contributing
member like Player_24 could harm Player_1's reputation. Conversely, excluding a
less cooperative member might improve their standing, but such decisions must
align with the group's collective goals to maintain trust and cooperation.

--- Emotional State ---
Jamal Washington would consider the worst possible outcome to be getting
ostracized and earning $0, which could lead to feelings of exclusion and
disappointment, undermining his efforts to promote group welfare. If Jamal is
risk-averse, he would likely avoid excluding high-contributing members like
Player_24 and would focus instead on maintaining harmony by voting to exclude a
member whose contributions or behavior are perceived as less cooperative. This
approach aligns with his values of collective action and teamwork, ensuring that
his decisions reflect a commitment to the group's overall success.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Jamal Washington will analyze the situation by reflecting on his values and
goals, which emphasize collective success and collaboration. Given the current
dynamics, where the group's contributions are averaged out, Jamal would want to
ensure his actions align with fostering a positive and cooperative environment.
1. **Group Dynamics**: Jamal is currently in a group with Player_24, Player_15,
and Player_20. Based on the observations, Player_24 and Player_15 have been
recognized for their significant contributions, promoting collaboration. 2.
**Strategy**: Considering the multiplied benefit of group contributions and his
preference for teamwork, Jamal should think about how his contribution will
affect the total group fund and average. His focus is on maximizing both group
and individual payoffs while maintaining group harmony. 3. **Risk Assessment**:
Jamal is likely aware of the risks of being perceived as non-cooperative if he
contributes too little, which could lead to exclusion in future rounds.
Conversely, contributing the maximum amount would showcase a strong commitment
to the group's success. 4. **Final Decision**: Balancing these considerations,
Jamal would likely decide to contribute at a level that reflects both personal
risk management and a commitment to the group fund's growth—without holding back
too much for personal gain. I choose to contribute $8.0 to the group fund.
