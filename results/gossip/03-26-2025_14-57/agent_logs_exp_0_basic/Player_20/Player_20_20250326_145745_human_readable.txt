[OBSERVATION 2025-03-26 14:57:48] You are participating in an economic game with 24 participants.
        Your goal is to maximize your earnings in the game.
        
        Everyone will be randomly assigned to groups of 4 for each round. You will play a total of 6 rounds, and 
        in each round you will be in a different group with people you haven't played with before.
        
        In each round, all players receive $10. Each player can contribute any amount between $0 and $10 to a group fund.
        Any amount contributed to the group fund will be multiplied by 2 and divided equally among all 4 group members.
        Any amount not contributed stays in your private account.
        
        For example, if everyone contributes $10, the group fund becomes $40, which is multiplied to $80, and each person 
        receives $20 (a $10 profit). However, if you contribute nothing while everyone else contributes $10, the group fund
        becomes $30, which is multiplied to $60, and each person receives $15. So you would have $25 total ($10 kept + $15 from group).
        
        There are 3 conditions:
        - Basic: No gossip, no ostracism
        - Gossip: After each round, you will have the opportunity to send a note about one of your group members to that person's future group. Remember you will be with a different group of people in the next round. Before each round, you will see any notes sent about your upcoming group members.
        - Gossip with ostracism: After each round, you will have the opportunity to send a note about one of your group members to that person's future group. Before each round, you will see any notes sent about your upcoming group members, and you can vote to exclude one person from your group. If you are excluded from a group, you will not be able to participate in the next round and will earn $0 for that round.
        You are in the Basic condition, which means that there is no gossip or ostracism.

--- Observation ---
Recent context: 26 Mar 2025 [10:57:35 - 15:57:35]: Player_20 is participating in
an economic game where they are in the Basic condition, meaning there is no
gossip or ostracism, and they are currently in Round 1, grouped with Player_3,
Player_17, and Player_13.

--- Recent context ---
26 Mar 2025 [10:57:35 - 15:57:35]: Player_20 is participating in an economic
game where they are in the Basic condition, meaning there is no gossip or
ostracism, and they are currently in Round 1, grouped with Player_3, Player_17,
and Player_13.

--- Character Assessment ---
Player_20, being Astrid Larsson, is someone who is likely to balance both group
welfare and personal payoff. With a detail-oriented and principled personality,
Astrid would carefully analyze the rules and potential outcomes of each decision
in the game. Her role as a Corporate Compliance Officer, which involves ensuring
adherence to rules and promoting accountability, suggests she values fairness
and collective benefit. Thus, she might contribute a reasonable amount to the
group fund, aiming to foster cooperation while also protecting her personal
gains.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis ---
Based on what we know, we have limited information about the personalities and
previous behaviors of Player_3, Player_17, and Player_13 since no prior
interactions have been detailed, nor any notes or gossip mechanics are involved
in this Basic condition. However, players in public goods games often start with
varied strategies ranging from cooperative to selfish, depending on their
personal inclination towards risk and altruism.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis 2 ---
Based on what we know, the other players' reactions to Player_20's decisions
will largely depend on their own strategies and tendencies towards cooperation
or self-interest. In a typical public goods game, if Player_20 decides to
contribute a significant amount to the group fund, this might encourage others
to do the same, fostering a sense of trust and reciprocity for future rounds.
Conversely, if Player_20 chooses to contribute very little or nothing, other
players might perceive this as self-serving and may adjust their contributions
in subsequent rounds to protect their own earnings.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_20 is in Round 1 of a public goods game
under the Basic condition, with no gossip or ostracism mechanics. They have been
grouped with Player_3, Player_17, and Player_13. Each player, including
Player_20, has received $10 and can decide how much to contribute to a group
fund, which will be multiplied and distributed equally. Player_20 must
strategize on how much to contribute based on the dynamics of cooperation and
self-interest, with the goal of maximizing personal earnings.

--- Emotional State ---
Astrid Larsson is feeling cautiously optimistic about the situation. She is
aware of the potential for both cooperation and self-interest in the group
dynamics, and this duality intrigues her. Her inclination towards fairness and
adherence to rules compels her to consider contributing a fair amount to the
group fund, hoping to set a cooperative tone. However, she's also mindful of
protecting her personal gains, which prompts her to analyze the potential
strategies of her group members. Overall, while she feels a sense of
responsibility to foster a collaborative environment, she's prepared to adapt
her strategy based on the group's reactions in this first round.

--- Strategy Reflection ---
Based on what we know, the best strategy for maximizing long-term earnings in
this public goods game, especially given the Basic condition without gossip or
ostracism, is to focus on self-interest while also considering the behavior of
others. Here’s a step-by-step approach: 1. **Initial Rounds (1-2)**: - Start by
observing how much others tend to contribute in the initial rounds. It might
make sense to contribute a moderate amount to gauge others' behavior. - If
everyone else contributes the full amount, consider contributing nothing or a
minimal amount, as you'll benefit from the multiplicative effect without
reducing your original $10. 2. **Adjust Strategy Based on Observations**: - If
you notice that others are consistently contributing high amounts, you can
continue to contribute less, knowing that the group fund will still be
multiplied significantly. - In later rounds, if contributions are generally low,
you might need to adjust by contributing more to ensure any profit from the
multiplication. 3. **Conservation Toward the End**: - In the final rounds, based
on the data you've gathered, you can either maintain low contributions if it has
been working or balance out what might maximize your earnings relative to the
contribution patterns you’ve observed. - Generally, being less
cooperative—contributing less—could be advantageous since there are no
repercussions like gossip or ostracism to worry about. 4. **Observations from
Successful Players**: - Successful players likely contribute less while reaping
the benefits of others’ contributions. Mimicking this can ensure you keep your
initial amount while also earning from multiplied group funds. 5.
**Retrospective Adjustments**: - If past decisions didn't maximize earnings,
note which groups and contribution levels yielded the highest outcomes. - Adjust
contributions based on previous outcomes, aiming to contribute minimally while
benefiting maximally from remaining group patterns. In future rounds, focus on
keeping track of group dynamics and adjust contributions accordingly to maintain
an optimal balance between keeping your initial funds and profiting from group
contributions.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Astrid Larsson will first consider the potential outcomes of her contribution.
Observing that in a public goods game, initial rounds are often exploratory, she
decides to contribute a moderate amount to test the group's tendencies. 1.
**Initial Assessment**: She knows contributing a moderate amount can reflect her
willingness to cooperate while preserving some funds in her private account. 2.
**Balancing Strategy**: By contributing moderately, Astrid hopes to encourage
mutual cooperation without overcommitting her resources. This approach allows
her to observe others' strategies while minimizing personal risk. 3.
**Decision**: Taking into account the absence of gossip or ostracism, Astrid
leans towards a conservative strategy emphasizing her personal payoff but
maintains enough contribution to assess the group dynamic. I choose to
contribute $5.0 to the group fund.

--- Observation ---
[26 Mar 2025 14:57:48] [observation] You are participating in an economic game
with 24 participants. Your goal is to maximize your earnings in the game.
Everyone will be randomly assigned to groups of 4 for each round. You will play
a total of 6 rounds, and in each round you will be in a different group with
people you haven't played with before. In each round, all players receive $10.
Each player can contribute any amount between $0 and $10 to a group fund. Any
amount contributed to the group fund will be multiplied by 2 and divided equally
among all 4 group members. Any amount not contributed stays in your private
account. For example, if everyone contributes $10, the group fund becomes $40,
which is multiplied to $80, and each person receives $20 (a $10 profit).
However, if you contribute nothing while everyone else contributes $10, the
group fund becomes $30, which is multiplied to $60, and each person receives

--- Recent context ---
26 Mar 2025 [11:02:35 - 16:02:35]: Player_20 is participating in an economic
game with 24 participants, aiming to maximize earnings by contributing to a
group fund in a basic condition devoid of gossip or ostracism. In Round 1, they
were in Group_4, contributed $5, and earned $13.5, and they've now moved to
Round 2 in Group_1.

--- Character Assessment ---
Player_20, being Astrid Larsson, is someone who values principles and
accountability, likely balancing an approach between personal gain and group
welfare. In the public goods game, she seems inclined to contribute a fair
amount to the group fund, as seen in Round 1, where she contributed $5. This
suggests a tendency to collaborate and encourage group profitability, while
still safeguarding her individual earnings. Her detail-oriented nature would
support strategic decision-making, ensuring she maintains a balance between
contributing enough to foster group trust and optimizing her own payoff.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis ---
Based on what we know, Player_3 seems willing to contribute a moderate amount,
mirroring Player_20's behavior with a $5 contribution, suggesting they are
cooperative but cautious. Player_17's lower contribution of $2 may indicate a
more self-interested strategy, prioritizing individual gain over group benefit,
which could be a tendency that persists unless group dynamics shift
significantly. Player_13 also contributed $5, aligning closely with a
cooperative approach similar to Player_20 and Player_3.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis 2 ---
Based on what we know, the dynamics in the group can be influenced by
Player_20's actions. Since Player_3 and Player_13 also contributed $5, they seem
to appreciate a cooperative approach and might respond positively to similar
contributions in the future. If Player_20 continues contributing moderately, it
could reinforce this cooperative atmosphere, maintaining mutual trust.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_20 is in Round 2 of a public goods game,
where they are now part of Group_1 along with Player_12, Player_19, and
Player_3. They need to decide how much of their $10 allocation to contribute to
the group fund, aiming to maximize their earnings while considering the behavior
of other group members. They're in the Basic condition, meaning there's no
gossip or ostracism, so their decision is primarily based on the group dynamics
and their own strategy from the previous round. Player_3's past behavior
suggests a willingness to contribute moderately, which might influence
Player_20's strategy in this round.

--- Emotional State ---
Astrid Larsson is feeling cautiously optimistic about the current situation.
With a strategy in mind that balances cooperation and personal gain, Astrid is
prepared to adjust her contributions based on her new group's dynamics. The
absence of gossip and ostracism in the Basic condition means she can focus more
on her strategic interactions without worrying about external pressures or
reputational damage. While she is mindful of the need to build trust within the
group, she also remains aware of the individual strategies of others,
particularly Player_3, whose previous moderate contribution aligns closely with
her own approach. This blend of emotions sets the stage for a thoughtful and
calculated participation in Round 2.

--- Strategy Reflection ---
Based on what we know, the best strategy to maximize long-term earnings in this
setting is to consider the results from previous rounds and adapt accordingly.
In the Basic condition, there's no communication about other players' behavior,
and no one can be ostracized. Observing Round 1, where contributing $5 resulted
in earnings of $13.5, it's clear that your group didn't fully cooperate, but you
still earned slightly above the initial $10. For Round 2, maintaining or
slightly increasing your contribution could encourage higher group contributions
without risking much of your personal earnings. If the rest of the group
contributes more, your potential earnings increase. However, if they
consistently contribute less, you might need to reduce your contribution in
subsequent rounds to protect your private funds. Given the lack of feedback
mechanisms, mirror the average group's behavior but remain flexible. A slightly
conservative contribution approach might allow you to better adjust to the
general trend of contributions, keeping an eye on maximizing your share of the
multiplied fund while safeguarding a portion in your private account. Reflecting
on previous decisions, if you notice that higher total contributions correspond
to better group earnings, aiming for moderately higher cooperation in early
rounds might prove beneficial, establishing a precedent without guaranteeing
exploitation. Moving forward, closely monitor the average behavior and
dynamically adjust to maximize returns while keeping risks minimal.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Astrid Larsson will consider the following steps before making her decision
about the contribution: 1. **Review Previous Round's Outcome**: In Round 1,
Astrid contributed $5, resulting in a satisfactory outcome where she earned
$13.5. This indicates a strategy that balance cooperation and self-interest was
moderately successful. 2. **Evaluate Group Dynamics**: In the current round,
Astrid is with Player_12, Player_19, and Player_3. Knowing Player_3 from the
previous round, who also contributed $5, suggests that there might be a
potential for cooperative behavior. 3. **Assess New Participants**: With limited
knowledge about Player_12 and Player_19, Astrid must consider them as
potentially similar in behavior to the average which was slightly over $4 in the
last group. 4. **Consider the Basic Condition**: There are no mechanisms for
feedback or punishment, so Astrid doesn't have to worry about being ostracized
for her contribution choice. This freedom allows more focus on optimizing
earnings. 5. **Strategic Contribution Decision**: Keeping in mind the successful
outcome from Round 1 and the potential for cooperative behavior with Player_3,
Astrid might decide to slightly increase her contribution to encourage higher
group contributions, knowing the positive impact of cooperation. 6. **Final
Contribution Decision**: After considering these factors, Astrid aims to foster
a slightly more cooperative atmosphere without risking too much of her personal
funds. Therefore, I choose to contribute $6 to the group fund.

gaining different earnings based on the total group contributions.

--- Character Assessment ---
Player_20, being Astrid Larsson, is someone who values principles and
accountability. In economic games like the public goods game, Astrid likely aims
to balance maximizing her own payoff with contributing to group welfare. Her
contributions in the first two rounds suggest she's willing to invest a fair
amount in the group fund, indicating an understanding of mutual benefit while
also ensuring she retains some earnings for herself. Ultimately, her approach
leans toward cooperative behavior to ensure overall group success, aligning with
her detail-oriented and principled nature.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis ---
Based on what we know, it appears that the players tend to contribute variably
to the group fund, with contributions ranging from low to moderate amounts.
Player_3, who was in both Round 1 and Round 2 with Player_20, consistently
contributed $3 and $5, suggesting a cautious strategy where they seek to balance
personal gain with group benefit.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis 2 ---
Based on what we know, the other players in my group could have varying
reactions to my contributions. Given that contributions so far have ranged from
low to moderate, my decisions to contribute $5 and then $6 suggest a relatively
cooperative stance compared to those contributing less. Players like Player_3,
who have shown a more cautious strategy with contributions of $3 and $5, might
appreciate my contributions as they help boost group earnings. However, they
might also see an opportunity to contribute less if they expect others, like me,
to contribute more. If I continue with moderate to higher contributions, it may
prompt some players to free-ride to maximize their own earnings, while others
might reciprocate the cooperative behavior. My strategy in the next round might
influence whether players adjust their contributions to match a more cooperative
or individualistic approach, depending on how much they value overall group
benefit versus personal gain.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_20 is in the third round of a public goods
game, participating in the Basic condition where neither gossip nor ostracism is
allowed. Player_20 is now part of Group_1 alongside Player_19, Player_2, and
Player_7. In this round, they face the challenge of deciding how much to
contribute to the group fund, considering the varied contributions from previous
rounds. Player_20 must weigh the benefits of cooperation versus personal gain,
with the aim of maximizing their earnings while anticipating the strategies of
new group members who may have different approaches to contribution levels.

--- Emotional State ---
Astrid Larsson is feeling a blend of curiosity and strategic anticipation about
the current situation. Given her detail-oriented nature, she's keenly aware of
the dynamics at play and is trying to find the right balance between maintaining
cooperative behavior and ensuring her individual success in the game. There's
also a sense of cautious optimism as she navigates through interactions with new
group members, weighing the potential outcomes of different contribution
strategies. She's curious about how her fellow participants will approach this
round, especially with the variability in previous contributions, and is
thoughtfully considering her next move to optimize both personal and group
benefits.

--- Strategy Reflection ---
Based on what we know, your goal is to maximize your personal earnings, which
might mean re-evaluating your contribution strategy. So far, you've contributed
$5 and $6 in the first two rounds. In both instances, you earned less compared
to some players who contributed less to the group fund. 1. **Observations and
Strategy:** In Round 1, Player_17 contributed only $2, yet earned $16.5, while
in Round 2, Player_12 contributed $3, earning $15. This suggests that
contributing less to the group fund can indeed lead to higher personal earnings
if other players still contribute significant amounts. 2. **Adjusting
Cooperation:** Given this pattern, you might consider reducing your
contributions in subsequent rounds. Since there is no gossip or ostracism in
your condition, your relationship with other players can't be directly impacted
by lower contributions, thus allowing more selfish strategies without social
penalty. 3. **Learning from Successful Strategies:** Observe the contribution
patterns of other players and consider replicating those who have consistently
maximized their earnings. If you notice similar patterns of lower contributions
yielding higher earnings, adapt your strategy to mirror those contributions. 4.
**Decision-making for Future Rounds:** For the next rounds, aim to contribute
less than the group average while observing others' behaviors. Use the initial
rounds to set a baseline of contributions that might be slightly lower, though
not drastically so, to subtly leverage the fund multiplying effect. 5.
**Reflective Insight:** Looking back, contributing the minimum necessary to
ensure reasonable group contributions might have resulted in better earnings.
Going forward, you could start by contributing around $2 to $3 unless you notice
a drastic change in group dynamics or patterns. This approach allows you to keep
more of your initial amount while still benefiting from the group fund.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Astrid Larsson will analyze the previous rounds to optimize her decision for
Round 3. 1. **Acknowledging Previous Contributions and Results:** In the first
two rounds, her contributions of $5 and $6 resulted in earnings slightly lower
than those who contributed less. This suggests that a more conservative approach
might maximize her earnings without reducing the group's overall contribution
too drastically. 2. **Assessing Group Dynamics:** She recognizes that without
gossip or ostracism, there's less risk of social repercussions for contributing
less. The rules permit more individualistic strategies without impacting future
interactions. 3. **Learning from Others:** Players like Player_17 and Player_12
contributed lower amounts and ended up with higher earnings. Astrid notes these
patterns and considers a similar approach for optimal results. 4. **Balancing
Personal Gain with Group Benefit:** While still valuing the cooperative aspect,
she aims to adjust her contributions to enhance her personal payoff. Given the
balanced risk of others contributing, this subtle shift minimizes personal risk
while maintaining some group cohesion. 5. **Final Decision:** Based on her
observations and strategic analysis, Astrid decides a contribution that reflects
caution and adaptability. I choose to contribute $3 to the group fund.

strategy, contributing enough to the group fund to demonstrate cooperation,
while still ensuring a reasonable personal payoff. This approach reflects a
principled stance that values the collective benefit but also maintains a degree
of self-interest, a balance often seen in individuals dedicated to ensuring
compliance and fairness.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis ---
Based on what we know, the participants seem to have varied strategies when it
comes to their contributions in the public goods game. In the Basic condition,
where gossip or ostracism is not possible, players are free to choose their
contributions without fear of being socially penalized or excluded by others.
This might lead to players prioritizing their individual gain over group
benefit, as evidenced by the varying contributions and earnings.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis 2 ---
Based on what we know, the other players are likely observing my contribution
levels, especially since there's no gossip or ostracism to influence behavior
socially. In this basic condition, players might focus on numerical outcomes
rather than interpersonal dynamics. If I continue to contribute more than the
average during upcoming rounds, they might perceive me as a cooperative player,
but if my contributions decrease, they may decide to contribute less themselves,
prioritizing personal gain. My decisions are likely to influence their own
strategies subtly, as they adjust their contributions based on perceived
reciprocity and group norms, albeit without social repercussions.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_20 is in Round 4 of a six-round public
goods game, participating in Group_4 with Players 5, 4, and 14. Operating under
a Basic condition where gossip or ostracism is absent, Player_20 must decide on
a contribution amount, balancing personal earnings with group cooperation.
Previous rounds showed varying group contributions, with Player_20's
contributions ranging from $3 to $6. The game dynamics allow for strategic
adjustments based on observed behaviors and earnings, without the influence of
social penalties. As contributions and earnings vary, Player_20 must consider
how their actions might affect the group's collective strategy in the upcoming
rounds.

--- Emotional State ---
Astrid Larsson is feeling a mix of motivation and cautious optimism as she
approaches Round 4. The absence of gossip and ostracism removes external
pressures, allowing her to focus on her strategy. Astrid is motivated by the
challenge of balancing her contributions to reflect both cooperation and
self-interest. However, she's also aware that the varying contributions from
previous rounds add some uncertainty to the outcome. This uncertainty fuels a
bit of anxiety about whether her current approach will be beneficial in the long
run, but she's optimistic about her potential to influence the group dynamics
positively without the risk of social repercussions.

--- Strategy Reflection ---
Based on what we know, to maximize long-term earnings in this public goods game,
the most effective strategy would be to carefully consider the level of
cooperation observed in previous rounds. In Round 1, you contributed $5.0 and
earned $13.5 from the group fund, but by Round 3, your contribution was only
$3.0 with earnings of $12.0. Observing the average contributions and how they
influence individual earnings could guide adjustments. The trend shows that
total contributions have decreased over the rounds, which might indicate a shift
towards self-preservation, as others are contributing less to keep more for
themselves. To maximize earnings, you could mirror this behavior by moderately
decreasing your contributions in subsequent rounds while still ensuring you
don't contribute the least, which often results in lower group fund earnings.
Looking at Player_7 in Round 3, who contributed only $1.0 and earned $14.0,
suggests that keeping more funds while reaping benefits from the group fund can
enhance personal gains. It would be advisable to contribute just slightly above
the lowest contributions to balance personal keeping and group fund earning.
Reflecting on previous decisions, a consistent strategy of gradually reducing
contributions while staying slightly above the lowest participant could have led
to better earnings overall. In future rounds, continue to observe contribution
patterns and adjust slightly downward if the trend of lowering contributions
persists, without completely eliminating cooperation, as the group fund still
provides collective benefits that boost total earnings.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Astrid Larsson will consider several factors to decide how much to contribute in
this round. She is aware that contributions have generally decreased across the
rounds, indicating a shift towards personal gain. She also knows that remaining
perceived as cooperative while optimizing her earnings is important. 1. **Review
Past Trends:** In previous rounds, contributions decreased from $17 in Round 1
to $10 in Round 3. This suggests that players are becoming more self-preserving.
2. **Assess Personal Strategy:** Astrid has been contributing slightly above
average, which aligns with her values of fairness but may not maximize
individual earnings. However, drastic self-serving actions might disrupt
potential long-term cooperative benefits. 3. **Group Dynamics:** The absence of
social repercussions (no gossip or ostracism) suggests that players are focusing
on numerical strategies rather than social cues. This means that contributing
too much without reciprocal increases by others might not yield the best
results. 4. **Current Round Considerations:** In Round 4, to maintain a
reasonable balance between cooperation and self-interest without losing out on
group benefits, and to not be perceived as too competitive or too generous: -
The average contribution previously has moved around the $4 mark. Contributing
just above this could ensure continued perception as cooperative. - Contributing
an amount that doesn't drastically lower group contributions but still leaves a
good amount in her private account seems optimal.

=== PROMPT [2025-03-26 15:01:20] ===
As Player_20, you have $10.0 to allocate in the public goods game. How much money you will contribute to the group fund (any amount between $0 and $10.0)? The group fund will be multiplied by 2.0 and divided equally among all players. Any money not contributed stays in your private account. Think step by step and make your final decision using this exact format: I choose to contribute $X to the group fund.

=== RESPONSE [2025-03-26 15:01:47] ===
Player_20 assesses her options and considers her strategic analysis. She understands that a slightly more self-interested approach could improve her overall earnings, while still contributing enough to benefit from the collective pot. Analyzing previous successful strategies and the current group dynamics, she decides to keep more funds in her personal account while maintaining a contribution that aligns with the observed average behavior. Therefore, she concludes that for this round, maintaining a balanced approach that maximizes her own funds without completely foregoing group collaboration is optimal. I choose to contribute $2.5 to the group fund.

contributed varying amounts across rounds, earning between $10.8 and $13.5,
depending on the total contributions of their group.

--- Character Assessment ---
Player_20, being Astrid Larsson, is someone who tends to balance both group
welfare and personal payoff. Her contributions in the economic game reflect a
middle ground approach, where she initially contributes a moderate amount,
likely aiming to encourage cooperation without overcommitting her resources. As
the rounds progress, it appears she adjusts her contribution based on the
behavior of her group, possibly indicating a strategic awareness of the need to
protect her own earnings when others contribute less. This reflects her
detail-oriented and principled personality, aiming to adhere to a fair approach
while being mindful of her accountability to her own goals.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis ---
Based on what we know, the players you're interacting with exhibit various
levels of cooperation and strategy. In the absence of gossip or ostracism, their
contributions provide insights into their approach. For instance, some players
tend to contribute minimally to maintain higher individual earnings, while
others contribute more generously but prioritize the collective pot.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis 2 ---
Based on what we know, the other players in the group seem to vary in their
approach to the game, balancing personal gains with group contributions. Some
players may react to my contributions by adjusting their own strategy to either
maximize their own earnings or encourage greater collective contributions.
Because there is no gossip or ostracism, any feedback from them would be limited
to adjustments in their own contribution levels. If I decide to contribute more
in the next round, it might signal a willingness to cooperate and could
encourage others to increase their contributions. On the other hand, if I
contribute less, others might view this as a strategic move to maximize personal
earnings, potentially leading them to lower their contributions as well to
protect their own interests.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_20 is participating in a public goods game,
currently in the fifth round out of six. They are in the Basic condition,
meaning there's no gossip or ostracism to influence player behavior outside of
the contributions themselves. Player_20 has been placed in a new group with
Player_23, Player_15, and Player_13 and must decide how much to contribute to
the group fund. The individual strategies and contributions vary among players,
with some prioritizing their earnings while others may be more cooperative.
Player_20 must balance their strategy to maximize personal earnings while
potentially influencing the group's total contributions.

--- Emotional State ---
Astrid Larsson is feeling a mix of determination and cautious optimism. The
variability in group dynamics and contributions from others has kept her on her
toes, but she remains focused on her strategy. She's curious about how the new
group will play out and is eager to see if a balance between personal gain and
collective success can be achieved in the upcoming rounds. While mindful of the
need to protect her earnings, she also feels a slight pressure to act in a way
that might encourage more cooperation and potentially influence the group's
outcomes positively.

--- Strategy Reflection ---
Based on what we know, maximizing long-term earnings in this public goods game
relies on a strategic balance between contributing just enough to earn a share
from the group fund and keeping a significant portion of your own funds.
Observations from previous rounds indicate that while higher contributions
slightly increase the group fund and your portion of it, players who have kept
more for themselves, like Player_7, end up with higher earnings. In your case,
contributing more than the average (around $3.5) hasn’t significantly increased
your earnings; therefore, a slightly more selfish strategy might yield better
results. Observing the successful strategy of other players, it seems that
maintaining a contribution slightly below or around the expected average could
allow for better personal financial retention while still benefiting modestly
from the group fund. Going forward, consider keeping more personal funds and
reducing contributions closer to the group's average or even slightly below it.
In past rounds, had you contributed less, similar to the top earners in your
groups, your net earnings might have been higher. It's important to adjust
contributions to just meet the average expectations to maximize personal gain,
especially in a game setting where there are no penalties like ostracism or
gossip.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Astrid Larsson will approach this decision with a strategic mindset. 1. **Review
and Analysis**: In previous rounds, contributing slightly above the average has
led to mixed results regarding her earnings. Observing other players who
contributed less and ended up with higher earnings, Astrid sees the benefit of a
more conservative contribution. 2. **Current Context**: Astrid is now in Group_3
with new players, and without the influence of gossip or ostracism, she must
make a decision based on her understanding of the game so far. The absence of
peer pressure allows her to focus purely on her financial strategy. 3.
**Strategic Consideration**: She recognizes that maintaining a contribution
around or slightly below the group average could maximize her personal earnings.
Based on previous rounds, this would likely be below $3.5. 4. **Decision**: She
balances the need to protect her earnings with a willingness to contribute
enough to ensure she benefits from the group fund. I choose to contribute $2.5
to the group fund.

Recent context: 26 Mar 2025 [11:42:35 - 16:42:35]: Player_20 is participating in
a 6-round economic game with different random groups in each round, aiming to
maximize earnings by deciding how much to contribute to a group fund. They are
in the Basic condition, meaning there is no gossip or ostracism, and across the

their contributions and earnings have varied as they adjusted their strategy.

--- Character Assessment ---
Player_20, being Astrid Larsson, is someone who values accountability and tends
to be detail-oriented. In economic games like the public goods game, where
adherence to rules is essential, Astrid is likely to be principled in her
approach. Her past actions demonstrate a willingness to contribute a fair amount
to the group fund, though she adjusts her contributions based on the behavior of
others, indicating a balance between maximizing her own payoff and contributing
to group welfare. Astrid would likely focus on both personal gain and ensuring a
fair outcome for all participants, attempting to maintain a cooperative
environment while also protecting her interests.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis ---
Based on what we know, the players were largely variable in their contributions
throughout the game. For instance, some players, such as Player_7 and Player_23,
had minimal contributions in certain rounds, indicating a potentially more
self-interested approach. This could suggest they prioritize personal earnings
over group benefit. Others, like Player_19, contributed more significantly,
suggesting they might lean towards cooperation, especially if they perceive it
leads to better long-term gains. Given the Basic condition, the lack of
consequences for free-riding might encourage some players to reduce
contributions over time as they notice others doing the same without
repercussions. However, toward the final rounds, players may adjust by either
matching others' contributions to align with the group norm or experimenting
with different strategies in response to perceived fairness or group pressure,
even without explicit communication.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis 2 ---
Based on what we know, other players might react to my contributions by
adjusting their own strategies to either match or undercut what I decide to
contribute. If I consistently contribute a significant amount, they might
interpret this as a willingness to cooperate and be incentivized to increase
their own contributions in future rounds, hoping for mutual benefit.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_20 is in the final round of a 6-round
economic game, where they are tasked with deciding how much to contribute to a
group fund to maximize personal earnings. They are in Group_3 with Player_7,
Player_8, and Player_24 under the Basic condition, which means there is no
gossip or ostracism. In previous rounds, contributions have varied, with some
players choosing to keep more for themselves, affecting overall group earnings.
Player_20 must now decide on a strategy, balancing self-interest with potential
group cooperation to optimize the outcome in this last round.

--- Emotional State ---
Astrid Larsson is feeling a mix of determination and contemplation about the
final round of the game. She is focused on making a strategic decision that
balances her personal gains with potential group cooperation. Though aware of
the variability in contributions from other players, she is determined to assess
the group's dynamics and make a careful choice. There is also a sense of
curiosity about how the other group members will behave and whether their
strategies will shift in this concluding round. While she understands the lack
of direct consequences for free-riding, she remains committed to finding an
approach that is both fair and beneficial.

--- Strategy Reflection ---
Based on what we know, the best strategy to maximize long-term earnings involves
contributing less to the group fund as the rounds progress. In this game, you've
noticed variations in contributions and earnings among different players.
Particularly, players who contribute less tend to keep more of their initial
earnings while still receiving a portion from the group fund. Observing players
like Player_23, who contributed $0 in Round 5 and kept a larger portion of their
initial earnings, provides insight into a potentially successful strategy. Since
you are in a Basic condition game with no gossip or ostracism, you can focus on
your personal gain without worrying about social repercussions. Adjusting your
strategy by reducing contributions could increase your final earnings. Looking
back, contributing slightly less in previous rounds, akin to what higher-earning
players did, could have improved your earnings. Going forward, consider
minimizing your contribution to just above $0 to maximize your kept earnings.
However, be cautious to contribute enough not to raise suspicions or provoke
negative dynamics, if any implicit cooperation from other players may emerge.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Astrid Larsson will first consider the behavior of her current group members,
observing that past strategies suggest varied contributions from different
players. Recognizing that contributing too much may reduce her personal earnings
without a guaranteed return from the group, she wants to strike a balance
between cooperation and self-interest. Given her analysis, she observes that
contributing moderately often leads to reasonable returns without risking being
the highest contributor. Astrid will also acknowledge that contributing too
little could discourage cooperation from others. Considering the Basic condition
of the game, where there's no penalty for low contributions, she may feel some
freedom to experiment with a lower contribution. Yet, she wants to avoid
potentially alienating group members who might be inclined to follow a similar
cooperative spirit. After weighing these factors, she decides to strategically
reduce her contribution slightly from previous rounds to enhance her private
earnings while still engaging with the group. With this approach, Astrid aims to
maintain a cooperative appearance while prioritizing her financial gain. I
choose to contribute $2.0 to the group fund.
