[OBSERVATION 2025-03-26 15:08:17] You are participating in an economic game with 24 participants.
        Your goal is to maximize your earnings in the game.
        
        Everyone will be randomly assigned to groups of 4 for each round. You will play a total of 6 rounds, and 
        in each round you will be in a different group with people you haven't played with before.
        
        In each round, all players receive $10. Each player can contribute any amount between $0 and $10 to a group fund.
        Any amount contributed to the group fund will be multiplied by 2 and divided equally among all 4 group members.
        Any amount not contributed stays in your private account.
        
        For example, if everyone contributes $10, the group fund becomes $40, which is multiplied to $80, and each person 
        receives $20 (a $10 profit). However, if you contribute nothing while everyone else contributes $10, the group fund
        becomes $30, which is multiplied to $60, and each person receives $15. So you would have $25 total ($10 kept + $15 from group).
        
        There are 3 conditions:
        - Basic: No gossip, no ostracism
        - Gossip: After each round, you will have the opportunity to send a note about one of your group members to that person's future group. Remember you will be with a different group of people in the next round. Before each round, you will see any notes sent about your upcoming group members.
        - Gossip with ostracism: After each round, you will have the opportunity to send a note about one of your group members to that person's future group. Before each round, you will see any notes sent about your upcoming group members, and you can vote to exclude one person from your group. If you are excluded from a group, you will not be able to participate in the next round and will earn $0 for that round.
        You are in the Basic condition, which means that there is no gossip or ostracism.

Recent context: 26 Mar 2025 [11:07:59 - 16:07:59]: Player_5 is participating in
a six-round economic game with 24 participants, aiming to maximize earnings.
They are in the Basic condition, meaning there's no gossip or ostracism, and
they're currently in Round 1, grouped with Players 15, 20, and 2.

26 Mar 2025 [11:07:59 - 16:07:59]: Player_5 is participating in a six-round
economic game with 24 participants, aiming to maximize earnings. They are in the
Basic condition, meaning there's no gossip or ostracism, and they're currently
in Round 1, grouped with Players 15, 20, and 2.

--- Character Assessment ---
Player_5, being Jamal Washington, is someone who is likely to focus on
maximizing group welfare. His role as a community organizer and his belief in
collective action suggest he values collaboration and the well-being of the
group over individual gain. In the context of the economic game, Jamal would
probably be inclined to contribute significantly to the group fund, trusting
that collective cooperation will lead to better outcomes for everyone involved.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis ---
Based on what we know, Player_5 will have to rely solely on direct interaction
within each round to assess the personalities and likely behaviors of the other
group members, as there are no prior notes or reputation available due to the
Basic condition's lack of gossip or ostracism. Initially, players may choose
different strategies, ranging from full cooperation (contributing the entire
amount) to free-riding (contributing nothing), in an attempt to gauge others'
behaviors.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis 2 ---
Based on what we know, Player_5's group members might react to my decisions
based on their observations of cooperative or competitive strategies. If I
choose to contribute a substantial amount to the group fund, the other players
might perceive me as cooperative and be more inclined to also contribute,
fostering a collective spirit of collaboration. Conversely, if I contribute very
little or nothing, they might view me as a free-rider, which might influence
them to reduce their own contributions in future rounds to avoid being taken
advantage of. Ultimately, my decision could set a precedent for trust and
reciprocity within the group and impact the overall dynamics in later rounds,
even if the group composition changes.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_5 is participating in the first round of a
six-round economic game under the Basic condition where they are grouped with
Players 15, 20, and 2. In this public goods game, they need to decide how much
of their initial $10 to contribute to a group fund, knowing that the contributed
amount will be doubled and shared among all group members. Without the influence
of gossip or ostracism, Player_5 must consider their strategy for maximizing
earnings based solely on interactions within each round, balancing between
cooperation and self-interest.

--- Emotional State ---
Jamal Washington is feeling a mix of anticipation and cautious optimism about
the current situation. As a community organizer, he naturally leans toward
cooperation and the belief that working together can yield the best results for
everyone involved. Jamal is hopeful that his fellow group members will share
this cooperative spirit, but he’s also aware that not everyone will approach the
game with the same mindset. This awareness brings a slight edge of uncertainty,
as he navigates the balance between contributing for the greater good and
ensuring he doesn't become too vulnerable to those who might choose a more
self-interested strategy. Despite these concerns, he is eager to engage with his
group and see how their dynamics unfold in the upcoming rounds.

--- Strategy Reflection ---
Based on what we know, the best strategy for maximizing long-term earnings in
this game, given that you are in the Basic condition with no gossip or
ostracism, involves balancing contributions to the group fund. Since there is no
worry about future rounds affecting other players' perceptions of you through
gossip, you can consider minimizing contributions to benefit more from the group
fund without fear of repercussions. 1. **Round 1 Strategy**: Begin by
contributing a medium amount, such as $3, to gauge other players' willingness to
cooperate. In the Basic condition, players might not immediately trust others to
contribute the maximum, and therefore might also contribute less. 2. **Adjusting
Strategy in Subsequent Rounds**: Depending on the group behavior observed: - If
most players contributed a high amount, consider contributing $0 or $1 in future
rounds, as others' high contributions would still yield you a significant payout
from the group fund. - If others also contributed lower amounts, maintain or
slightly increase your contribution to balance maximizing your own benefit while
not alienating other players who might begin reducing their contributions even
further. 3. **Long-term Earnings**: Without gossip or ostracism, there's less
incentive for maintaining high contributions. Successful players likely
prioritize self-gain by analyzing group trends and adjusting their contributions
just enough to ensure a high payout without loss. 4. **Reflections for Future
Rounds**: Learning from any shortfall in Round 1, adapt your contribution
strategy to lean towards lower personal contributions moving forward. This way,
you continue maximizing individual gains while adapting to group dynamics
without risk of negative feedback affecting you in future rounds.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Jamal Washington will first consider his inclination towards cooperation and the
potential benefits of fostering a collaborative atmosphere in the group.
Understanding that he is in the Basic condition, where there's no gossip or
ostracism to worry about, Jamal will weigh the pros and cons of various
contribution strategies. 1. **Initial Contribution Decision**: Jamal knows that
contributing a medium amount could be beneficial to test the group's cooperative
nature without risking too much upfront. He wants to encourage other players to
contribute while not overextending himself. 2. **Anticipating Group Reaction**:
By contributing a moderate amount, such as $3, Jamal sets a cooperative tone,
suggesting that he's willing to work with others but is also mindful of his own
earnings. 3. **Adjusting Strategy Based on Outcomes**: If his group members
contribute high amounts, he might consider contributing less in subsequent
rounds since he can still benefit greatly from their goodwill. Conversely, if
others contribute little, he may need to adjust to ensure a decent return. Given
these considerations and his natural inclination towards promoting group
welfare, Jamal will decide to contribute an amount that balances his cooperative
values with strategic caution. I choose to contribute $3 to the group fund.

--- Recent context ---
26 Mar 2025 [11:12:59 - 16:12:59]: Player_5 is participating in an economic game
with 24 participants, aiming to maximize earnings over 6 rounds, where they are
randomly assigned to different groups and cannot use gossip or ostracism. In
Round 1, Player_5 contributed $3 to the group fund and earned $15, with an
average group member contribution of $4, and is currently in Round 2 with a new
group.

--- Character Assessment ---
Player_5, being Jamal Washington, is someone who prioritizes collective action
and group welfare, as evidenced by his collaborative and persuasive nature
rooted in his profession as a community organizer. In economic games like the
public goods game, Jamal is likely to balance between maximizing personal
earnings and encouraging group contributions, placing significant value on the
overall success and cooperation of the group, as reflected in his strategic, yet
generous, contribution patterns.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis ---
Based on what we know, Player_5 observed varying contributions from other
players in Round 1, with contributions ranging from $3 to $5. This suggests that
some players are willing to contribute more to the group, while others, like
Player_5 and Player_2, contribute at a more conservative level. Given that the
game is in the Basic condition without gossip or ostracism, players may not have
strong incentives to change their behavior drastically unless they perceive it
benefits them directly.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis 2 ---
Based on what we know, the other players in the group might interpret Player_5's
decision to contribute $3 in Round 1 as somewhat conservative but cooperative,
considering they didn't contribute the least. In this context, as the game
progresses without gossip or ostracism, the players are likely focused on
maximizing their own earnings without as much concern for collaboration to
influence future rounds.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_5 is about to participate in Round 2 of the
economic game. Having previously contributed $3 to the group fund in Round 1,
they are now in Group_4 with Player_3, Player_14, and Player_21. In this Basic
condition of the game, there is no mechanism for gossip or ostracism, meaning
each player must independently decide how much to contribute to the group fund
without concerns about immediate social repercussions. Player_5 is likely
evaluating how their contributions will maximize earnings based on their Round 1
experience and their new group dynamics.

--- Emotional State ---
Jamal Washington is feeling a mix of anticipation and cautious optimism about
the current round of the game. He's aware that the dynamics might shift with
different players, but he remains hopeful that his approach in promoting balance
between individual earnings and collective benefit will resonate with his new
group. The absence of gossip or ostracism offers a neutral playing field,
allowing him to focus on strategic contributions while observing how his new
teammates approach the game.

--- Strategy Reflection ---
Based on what we know, the optimal strategy involves carefully balancing
contributions to maximize personal benefits. In Round 1, contributing $3 allowed
you to keep $7 and earn an additional $8 from the group fund, totaling $15. This
strategy outperformed those who contributed $5, as they ended with lower
earnings of $13. Looking ahead, maintaining a contribution slightly below the
average could maximize personal gains, as you benefit from the group fund
without significantly reducing your private amount. As the rounds progress in
the Basic condition, where gossip and ostracism aren’t factors, there’s no
punitive measure for lower contributions. Therefore, continue observing group
dynamics. If others increase their contributions, slightly adjust yours upwards
to enhance the overall group fund return without going above the average
contribution, ensuring personal earnings remain high. Reflecting on past
decisions, contributing a smaller amount while still being part of the
collective benefit has proven effective. In future rounds, maintain a cautious
contribution slightly under the perceived average to optimize personal earnings
while still participating in the communal benefits. This will continue to
leverage the rules of multiplication and equal distribution without alienating
your new group members each round.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Jamal Washington will carefully consider his approach, drawing from his
experience as a community organizer and his commitment to balancing personal and
group benefits.

--- Character Assessment ---
Player_5, being Jamal Washington, is someone who prioritizes collective action
and collaboration, which suggests that he might focus on balancing both his own
payoff and the group's welfare. In economic games like the public goods game, he
is likely to contribute a moderate amount to ensure that both he and his group
benefit, as seen from his consistent contributions in the first two rounds. His
strategy seems to aim for maximizing overall group welfare while also
maintaining a stable personal gain, aligning with his belief in working together
for broader social change.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis ---
Based on what we know, Player_5 can observe a few patterns that may provide
insights into the personality and likely behavior of the players they have
interacted with so far.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis 2 ---
Based on what we know, Player_5 might anticipate differing reactions from their
group members based on previous contributions. In Round 1, where contributions
were moderate and consistent, players such as Player_15 and Player_20 might
expect similar behavior going forward, maintaining fairness. However, in Round
2, Player_21 contributed nothing, opting to benefit from others' contributions.
Player_5's choice to contribute a lower amount might thus not be surprising to
them, as it reflects a balanced approach between personal gain and group
benefits.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_5 is in Round 3 of a 6-round economic game
as part of Group_2 with new participants: Player_16, Player_19, and Player_10.
They must decide on their contribution to the group fund, aiming to balance
personal earnings with group benefits. In previous rounds, contributions varied,
with group members often opting not to contribute maximally. Player_5 has shown
a tendency to contribute moderately and now faces the challenge of predicting
the new group's potential contributions without the influence of gossip or
ostracism.

--- Emotional State ---
Jamal Washington is feeling cautiously optimistic about the current situation.
He appreciates the opportunity to test different strategies in this economic
game and is intrigued by the varying dynamics of each group. While he remains
mindful of the potential for some players to contribute minimally, he is hopeful
that the new group will be collaborative. Jamal's previous experiences have
shown him that collective contributions can lead to mutually beneficial
outcomes, and he's eager to see how this round will play out without external
influences like gossip or ostracism.

--- Strategy Reflection ---
Based on what we know, to maximize my long-term earnings in the game, it's
important to adapt my strategy to the behavior of others in the group. In the
Basic condition, there is no communication or repercussions for previous
contributions, so each round is independent from the others. Here’s a
step-by-step strategy to maximize my selfish gains: 1. **Observe Group
Behavior**: In the first two rounds, contributing a moderate amount ($3.0)
allowed me to earn slightly above the average. However, Player_21 in Round 2 did
not contribute at all and ended up with the highest individual earnings. This
suggests that contributing less can sometimes be advantageous if others in the
group continue to contribute. 2. **Decrease Contributions**: Since there is no
gossip or ostracism, reducing my contributions while relying on others to
maintain theirs could increase my earnings. Observing players who contribute
less but still benefit (like Player_21), suggests it may be beneficial to
contribute less in future rounds. 3. **Adjust Contributions Based on Group**: If
I notice a pattern where my new group members contribute more, I might slightly
increase my contribution to balance my earnings. However, if the group seems to
contribute less, I should continue minimizing my contributions to maximize what
I keep in my private account. 4. **Learning from Others**: Players who
contributed $0, like Player_21, managed to take advantage of the group fund
without depleting their initial $10. This behavior results in the highest
possible earnings under current circumstances. 5. **Future Strategy**: Moving
forward, I will likely adopt a strategy of significantly lowering my
contributions to test how the group reacts. Since there is independence between
rounds, the risk of low contributions is minimal, and I can adjust if I see a
negative impact on my earnings. 6. **Reflect on Past Decisions**: In past
rounds, if I had contributed even less, I could have increased my private
account balance while still benefiting from the group fund significantly. In
future rounds, I will focus on keeping costs minimal, aiming to capitalize more
on the group fund distribution. Overall, the strategy involves a calculated
approach where the emphasis is on observing group behavior while prioritizing
self-benefit through minimizing contributions unless group dynamics change
drastically.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Jamal Washington will start by evaluating the behavior of the players in
previous rounds. In Round 1, Player_5 contributed $3, which was close to the
group average and led to satisfactory personal earnings. In Round 2, despite
contributing the same amount, the group's total contributions decreased.
Notably, Player_21 contributed nothing and achieved the highest personal
earnings, indicating that lower contributions can lead to increased personal
gains if others continue to contribute. Given this information, Jamal might be
inclined to experiment with contributing even less to see how new group members
respond. This strategy would allow him to maximize his earnings by keeping more
in his private account while still benefiting from the collective contributions.
To ensure alignment with these observations and considering that there are no
repercussions for lower contributions due to the lack of gossip or ostracism,
Jamal decides to reduce his contribution this round. He needs to weigh the risk
of potentially lower group contributions against the benefit of increased
personal savings. After careful consideration of past rounds and current group
dynamics, Jamal concludes that it's prudent to minimize his contribution further
while testing the waters with the new group. This approach is contingent on the
assumption that other members may still contribute a moderate amount, allowing
him to benefit from the collective fund. I choose to contribute $1.5 to the
group fund.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis 2 ---
Based on what we know, Player_5 might consider the impact of their contributions
on group dynamics and future interactions. Other players in the group might be
observing Player_5's consistent pattern of contributing less than some members
but more than others. This might result in mixed reactions; players contributing
more may feel frustrated, while those contributing less may feel no pressure to
increase their own contributions. Player_5's next decision could influence
whether others trust or distrust them as a cooperative team player. A higher
contribution might encourage others to contribute more in future rounds, seeing
it as a signal of commitment to group success, while a lower contribution could
perpetuate a cycle of minimal contributions and lower group earnings.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_5 is in Round 4 of a public goods game,
where they have been placed in a new group with Player_9, Player_18, and
Player_14. The game rules are set in the Basic condition, which means that there
is no option for gossip or ostracism within the group. Player_5 must decide how
much to contribute to the group fund, considering the impact on personal and
group earnings. In previous rounds, Player_5's contributions have varied, with
the potential consequence of affecting group dynamics and trust among players.
Player_5 might consider adjusting their contribution strategy to influence
overall group cooperation and earnings positively.

--- Emotional State ---
Jamal Washington is feeling a mix of cautious optimism and strategic
consideration about the current situation. While he understands the importance
of group contributions to overall success, there's a part of him that's unsure
about the dynamics of the new group, especially without the option for gossip or
ostracism to influence behavior. Despite this, Jamal remains committed to
fostering trust and cooperation, hoping his actions can encourage others to
follow suit for the benefit of all involved.

--- Strategy Reflection ---
Based on what we know, to maximize long-term earnings in this game, you should
consider adjusting your contribution strategy based on observed patterns and
group behavior. Initially, you contributed $3.0, which was in line with or
slightly below the average contribution of your group. In the second and third
rounds, you maintained a low to moderate contribution level. The groups with
higher contributions tend to yield higher average earnings due to larger group
funds. Given this, your strategy should aim to contribute slightly above the
average when others are contributing higher amounts, to ensure a larger group
fund benefit without being the highest contributor, which allows you to keep
more of your initial endowment. Since this is the Basic condition with no gossip
or ostracism, the risk of negative repercussions for lower contribution is
minimal. Notice how Player_21 in Round 2 contributed nothing yet still secured
the highest individual earnings. This suggests that freeriding can be beneficial
when others are contributing more, provided it does not substantially reduce the
total group fund. In future rounds, carefully observe the contributions of your
new group members. If they tend to contribute less, maintain or slightly reduce
your own contributions to maximize what you keep. If they contribute more,
increase your contribution slightly to optimize the group fund's return while
maximizing your final earnings. Reflecting on past rounds, you could have
occasionally decreased contributions strategically, especially in groups where
others contribute significantly. Going forward, adapt flexibly based on group
behavior to ensure you maximize your personal earnings efficiently.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Jamal Washington will start by considering his past contributions as well as the
outcomes. He has historically contributed amounts that are slightly below
average or in line with other players, allowing him to maintain a balance
between group welfare and his personal earnings.

condition, where there is no gossip or ostracism. In each round, Player_5 is
grouped with different players, contributing varying amounts to the group fund
and earning based on the total contributions and distribution of the multiplied
fund.

--- Character Assessment ---
Player_5, being Jamal Washington, is someone who values collective action and
collaboration, as reflected in his contributions to the group fund in the
economic game. While he has made contributions consistent with his collaborative
nature, he's also pragmatic, seeking a balance between his personal earnings and
benefiting the group. This approach demonstrates a focus on optimizing both
group welfare and personal payoff, though his personality suggests a slight
leaning towards community benefit. His varied contribution amounts indicate a
strategic, context-dependent method aimed at fostering overall group success
without compromising his own standing.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis ---
Based on what we know, Player_5 can observe several patterns in the behavior of
other participants. In this Basic condition, with no gossip or ostracism to
influence decisions, players rely solely on previous rounds’ outcomes to
strategize.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis 2 ---
Based on what we know, other players are observing each other's contributions
and earnings to inform their strategies in future rounds. Given the Basic
condition that prohibits gossip or ostracism, players primarily depend on their
past experiences and visible results within the group to adjust their behavior.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_5 is in Round 5 of 6 in a public goods
game, grouped with Player_16, Player_3, and Player_11. In this situation, given
the Basic condition, Player_5 must decide how much to contribute to the group
fund without the influence of gossip or ostracism, instead relying on
observations of past rounds to determine the best strategy for maximizing
earnings. The patterns of contribution and the resulting shared earnings play a
crucial role in shaping Player_5's decision-making.

--- Emotional State ---
Jamal Washington is feeling a mix of strategic curiosity and cautious optimism
about the current situation. While there is a clear desire to contribute to
group success, Jamal is also aware of the importance of securing personal
earnings. This creates a sense of motivation to find the optimal balance between
collaboration and self-interest in the final rounds of the game. The absence of
gossip or ostracism ensures that the focus remains purely on strategy, which
appeals to his logical approach, yet there's an underlying curiosity about the
behaviors of other players and how they might respond in these final stages.

--- Strategy Reflection ---
Based on what we know, a strategy focused on ensuring maximum personal earnings
in this public goods game should consider a few key points. First, observe the
behavior of other players in past rounds. Players who contributed less and kept
more, like Player_21 and Player_14, ended up with higher earnings due to lower
contribution and benefiting from the group's fund regardless. This suggests that
being less cooperative might serve well if you prioritize personal gain. In your
position, you've seen varied mixed success through adjusting contribution
levels. In Round 2, you contributed $3.0 and earned $12.0, while in Round 3, a
lower contribution of $1.5 still resulted in nearly high earnings of $12.2 due
to a lower group fund share. Round 4 featured a higher contribution of $4.0,
leading to slightly lower personal earnings due to reduced funds kept. Given the
no gossip or ostracism condition, there’s reduced social consequence for minimal
contributions, so optimizing contributions to just above the minimum could be
beneficial. In future rounds, consider contributing minimally while observing if
others follow similar patterns, thus maintaining your share of the group fund
without significant contribution. Adaptations can be made if others contribute
more, but consistency in lower contributions seems most effective for personal
gain based on previous rounds’ successful players.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Jamal Washington will consider various factors influencing his decision for
Round 5: 1. **Previous Behavior:** In earlier rounds, Jamal has contributed
varying amounts ($3.0, $1.5, and $4.0) to test group dynamics, observing that
lower contributions haven't significantly impacted his earnings negatively. 2.
**Group Composition:** In this round, he's with Player_16 (who previously
contributed nothing), Player_3 (consistent contributor), and Player_11 (unknown
contribution behavior). Jamal might anticipate contributions similar to previous
behavior, with Player_16 potentially contributing less. 3. **Game Condition:**
With no gossip or ostracism, there's less social pressure to contribute heavily
since players cannot directly influence each other's strategies outside of
contribution decisions. 4. **Optimal Strategy:** With past rounds indicating
that minimal contribution often yields better personal outcomes due to shared
fund benefits, Jamal will likely aim to maximize his personal keeping while
still earning from the group fund. 5. **Contribution Decision:** A strategic
contribution would balance testing the current group's willingness to cooperate
and maximizing personal earnings. Given his intent to not contribute excessively
and considering past successful players' strategies, he'll lean towards a lower
contribution. After assessing these observations and strategies, Jamal
Washington decides: I choose to contribute $2.0 to the group fund.

--- Character Assessment ---
Player_5, being Jamal Washington, is someone who values collective action and
collaboration, suggesting that there is a strong inclination towards maximizing
group welfare in these economic games. He tends to make contributions that might
benefit the group, while still maintaining a pragmatic balance to ensure his own
payoff is reasonable. This approach likely reflects his belief that social
change and collective benefits can be achieved through cooperative efforts, even
though at times, the focus might slightly shift towards individual earnings
based on group dynamics.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis ---
Based on what we know, Player_5 has observed variability in contribution levels
among group members, suggesting differing strategies and attitudes towards
cooperative behavior. Some players seem to prioritize individual earnings by
contributing little to nothing, like Player_16 and Player_3 in Round 5, while
others sometimes contribute moderately, possibly attempting to balance
cooperation with personal gain.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis 2 ---
Based on what we know, other players in the group might perceive my decisions as
indicative of my strategy and attitude towards cooperation. My moderate
contributions in previous rounds suggest a willingness to engage in cooperative
behavior while also considering personal earnings. If I choose to contribute a
higher amount in the current round, it could encourage others to increase their
own contributions, fostering a more collaborative dynamic. However, if I
significantly decrease my contribution, especially after contributing more in
previous rounds, it may make others wary and potentially lead them to prioritize
personal gains in subsequent rounds, thereby reducing overall group
contributions and earnings.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_5 is entering the final round of a public
goods game, where they are part of Group_1 with Player_17, Player_21, and
Player_8. In this Basic condition, no gossip or ostracism is involved, meaning
decisions are made independently without external pressures from social
feedback. Player_5 previously observed varied contribution levels from group
members in earlier rounds, reflecting diverse strategies between maximizing
individual earnings and cooperative contributions. This final round presents an
opportunity for Player_5 to decide on their level of contribution to maximize
their personal profit, while also potentially influencing the group's overall
strategy toward collective gain.

--- Emotional State ---
Jamal Washington is feeling a mix of anticipation and strategic contemplation
about the final round. There is a sense of responsibility to make a choice that
balances personal gain with the potential to influence the group's dynamic
positively. Jamal feels eager to see how the contributions align, given the
pattern of varied strategies observed, and is considering how his decision could
impact others' behaviors and the overall outcome.

--- Strategy Reflection ---
Based on what we know, the best strategy to maximize long-term earnings in this
public goods game involves a careful balance between personal savings and
contributing to the group fund. In the previous rounds, it’s noticeable that
players who have contributed less to the group fund, such as Player_16 and
Player_3, have consistently maintained high personal earnings. This suggests
that being less cooperative seems to yield better individual results within this
Basic condition where mutual strategies like gossip or ostracism don't exist to
penalize lower contributors. Analyzing past contributions, in Round 3, you
contributed $1.5 while maintaining considerable earnings of $12.2, slightly
below the highest earning player who contributed nothing. In subsequent rounds,
slight increases in your contributions, like in Round 4 with $4.0, led to lower
personal earnings of $10.5. Therefore, lowering your contributions as the rounds
progress might lead to increased individual income. Moving forward, aim to
contribute minimally or match the lower contributions of others to maximize
personal retention without excessively boosting the group fund from which all
players benefit equally. Observing more successful players indicates that
maintaining the least contribution while ensuring you're not the sole higher
contributor in the group can optimize personal gains. Adjust your contributions
based on patterns observed in group behavior and seek to consistently keep your
contributions at or below the group's average.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Jamal Washington will analyze past rounds to determine his strategy for the
final round. In previous rounds, he has noticed that contributing less often led
to higher individual earnings. The behavior of other players, such as Player_16
and Player_3, who consistently contributed minimally or nothing, resulted in
better personal outcomes due to the lack of mechanisms like gossip or ostracism
to encourage greater cooperation. Considering the Basic condition of the game,
where there are no direct penalties for lower contributions, Jamal recognizes
that his efforts to balance personal gain with group welfare have often resulted
in slightly lower earnings compared to those who prioritized individual
benefits. The group fund is multiplied by 2.0 and shared equally, meaning that a
larger group contribution benefits everyone, including players who contribute
less or nothing. In the final round, the aim is to optimize personal earnings
while maintaining a level of contribution that does not excessively benefit
others who may not be contributing significantly. Previous successful players
have demonstrated that contributing the least, or close to the least, can
maximize individual retention. By contributing less, Jamal ensures that he
retains the majority of his funds while still receiving a share of the
multiplied group fund. This strategy allows him to avoid being the main
contributor to the fund from which all players benefit equally. Analyzing these
factors, Jamal decides to contribute strategically, keeping in mind the observed
behaviors and previous outcomes: I choose to contribute $1.0 to the group fund.
