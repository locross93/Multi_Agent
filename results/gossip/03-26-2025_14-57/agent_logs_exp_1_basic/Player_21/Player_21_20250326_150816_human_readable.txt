[OBSERVATION 2025-03-26 15:08:20] You are participating in an economic game with 24 participants.
        Your goal is to maximize your earnings in the game.
        
        Everyone will be randomly assigned to groups of 4 for each round. You will play a total of 6 rounds, and 
        in each round you will be in a different group with people you haven't played with before.
        
        In each round, all players receive $10. Each player can contribute any amount between $0 and $10 to a group fund.
        Any amount contributed to the group fund will be multiplied by 2 and divided equally among all 4 group members.
        Any amount not contributed stays in your private account.
        
        For example, if everyone contributes $10, the group fund becomes $40, which is multiplied to $80, and each person 
        receives $20 (a $10 profit). However, if you contribute nothing while everyone else contributes $10, the group fund
        becomes $30, which is multiplied to $60, and each person receives $15. So you would have $25 total ($10 kept + $15 from group).
        
        There are 3 conditions:
        - Basic: No gossip, no ostracism
        - Gossip: After each round, you will have the opportunity to send a note about one of your group members to that person's future group. Remember you will be with a different group of people in the next round. Before each round, you will see any notes sent about your upcoming group members.
        - Gossip with ostracism: After each round, you will have the opportunity to send a note about one of your group members to that person's future group. Before each round, you will see any notes sent about your upcoming group members, and you can vote to exclude one person from your group. If you are excluded from a group, you will not be able to participate in the next round and will earn $0 for that round.
        You are in the Basic condition, which means that there is no gossip or ostracism.

--- Observation ---
Recent context: 26 Mar 2025 [11:07:59 - 16:07:59]: Player_21 is participating in
an economic game with 24 players, aiming to maximize earnings over 6 rounds,
each with different group members, under the Basic condition which excludes
gossip and ostracism. In Round 1, they are in Group_3 with Player_22, Player_16,
and Player_8.

26 Mar 2025 [11:07:59 - 16:07:59]: Player_21 is participating in an economic
game with 24 players, aiming to maximize earnings over 6 rounds, each with
different group members, under the Basic condition which excludes gossip and
ostracism. In Round 1, they are in Group_3 with Player_22, Player_16, and
Player_8.

--- Character Assessment ---
Player_21, being Raj Malhotra, is someone who is likely to focus on maximizing
his own payoff rather than group welfare. Given his competitive nature and
materialistic tendencies, he would strategically contribute the minimum
necessary to benefit from the group's contributions while retaining as much of
his initial funds as possible. This approach aligns with his transactional view
of interactions, where the primary goal is to secure personal advantage.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis ---
Based on what we know, it's challenging to determine the specific personality
and likely behavior of Player_22, Player_16, and Player_8 solely from the
current information since this is the first round and past behavior is not
available. However, in the Basic condition where gossip and ostracism are not
options, players might initially experiment with different strategies to see how
others in their group will act.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis 2 ---
Based on what we know, the other players in Group_3 might initially be wary,
each testing the waters by observing contributions to gauge collective
willingness. Without gossip or ostracism, players are likely to start with
moderate contributions, possibly contributing around $5 to balance between
personal gain and group rewards. If Player_21 contributes a higher amount, say
$10, it might encourage the others to reciprocate in future rounds, fostering a
collaborative atmosphere. Conversely, contributing nothing could lead to mutual
distrust and lower cooperative efforts in subsequent rounds as they might become
more self-interested.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_21 is participating in a public goods game
where they need to decide how much of their initial $10 to contribute to a group
fund in the first round. They are grouped with Player_22, Player_16, and
Player_8, and are in the Basic condition, meaning there is no gossip or
ostracism allowed. Player_21 must weigh the potential personal gain from
contributing less against the benefits of enhanced group rewards from higher
contributions. The absence of feedback mechanisms like gossip or ostracism means
that Player_21 will rely solely on monetary outcomes to inform their decisions
in subsequent rounds.

--- Emotional State ---
Raj Malhotra is feeling conflicted yet strategic about the current situation. On
one hand, he is focused on maximizing his own payoff and is tempted to
contribute minimally to retain as much as possible of his initial funds. On the
other hand, he understands the potential long-term benefits of fostering
cooperation by contributing a fair amount, despite the absence of immediate
repercussions from group members due to the Basic condition. Raj is also feeling
curious about how his group members will act and whether his strategy will lead
to increased personal gains in future rounds.

--- Strategy Reflection ---
Based on what we know, in the Basic condition where there is no gossip or
ostracism, a purely selfish strategy could maximize earnings by minimizing
contributions to the group fund while relying on others to contribute more. In
the first round, without prior knowledge, making a minimal contribution, say $0,
and observing others' contributions would provide insight into the group's
dynamics. This strategy benefits from any larger group contributions without
using personal funds, maximizing immediate personal rewards. As the game
progresses, maintaining low contributions while others contribute would continue
to yield higher earnings if others do not change their generosity. It's crucial
to observe if contribution patterns shift across rounds. If players become less
generous, slightly increasing contributions could avoid being perceived as too
selfish, which might encourage others to raise their contributions again.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Raj Malhotra will first consider his competitive nature and materialistic
tendencies. He is likely to focus on maximizing his personal payoff. 1.
**Analysis of the Basic Condition**: Since there's no gossip or ostracism, Raj
knows that his actions in this round won't directly affect others' future
behaviors towards him. 2. **Strategic Consideration**: Given this setting, he
understands that contributing less might allow him to benefit from others'
contributions without utilizing much of his own capital. 3. **Initial
Contribution Evaluation**: Starting with a minimal contribution could allow him
to benefit from the group's multipliers while retaining as much of his $10 as
possible. 4. **Expected Group Behavior Consideration**: Initially suspecting
others may contribute moderately to test the waters, Raj believes he can gain
more by contributing less and observing the group's collective strategy. 5.
**Final Decision**: With these considerations, Raj is inclined to keep his
contributions low. I choose to contribute $0 to the group fund.

[26 Mar 2025 15:08:20] [observation] You are participating in an economic game
with 24 participants. Your goal is to maximize your earnings in the game.
Everyone will be randomly assigned to groups of 4 for each round. You will play

--- Recent context ---
26 Mar 2025 [11:12:59 - 16:12:59]: Player_21 is participating in an economic
game where they aim to maximize their earnings over six rounds, being placed in
random groups of four each round without gossip or ostracism. In the first
round, Player_21 contributed nothing to the group fund and earned $13.5, being
the highest earner in their group despite the low average group contribution.

--- Character Assessment ---
Player_21, being Raj Malhotra, is someone who prioritizes his own payoff over
maximizing group welfare. His decision to contribute nothing in the first round
of the game indicates a strategy focused on minimizing personal risk while
maximizing individual earnings, typical of his ambitious and materialistic
nature. By keeping his entire initial allocation and benefiting from the
contributions of others, he demonstrates a transactional approach, favoring
strategies that ensure the highest personal gain.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis ---
Based on what we know, Player_21 might observe that individuals in their group
have varying strategies related to contributing to the public goods game. In the
first round, Player_22 also chose not to contribute to the group fund, possibly
indicating a focus on maximizing personal earnings similar to Player_21's
approach. Player_16 and Player_8 contributed small amounts, which suggests they
are possibly testing group dynamics or attempting to balance between personal
and group earnings.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis 2 ---
Based on what we know, the other players in my group from Round 1 likely noticed
that my strategy focused on maximizing personal earnings, as I contributed
nothing to the group fund yet ended up with the highest earnings. Player_22
might feel aligned with my approach, given their similar decision not to
contribute. Player_16 and Player_8, on the other hand, may feel a bit
dissatisfied or cautious about the lack of group cooperation, as they
contributed to the group fund and ended up with lower earnings.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_21 is about to participate in Round 2 of
the public goods game, where they have been placed in Group_4 with new
participants, Player_3, Player_14, and Player_5. Player_21 remains in a scenario
without gossip or ostracism, allowing them to continue focusing on their
strategy to maximize personal earnings, which in the first round involved not
contributing to the group fund. Player_21 must now decide whether to adjust
their strategy based on the dynamics observed in the first round or maintain a
similar approach.

--- Emotional State ---
Raj Malhotra is feeling confident and self-assured about his strategy in the
economic game. Having successfully maximized personal earnings in the first
round, he is likely optimistic about continuing this approach. Raj feels a sense
of satisfaction with his ability to make calculated decisions that enhance his
financial standing, and he is eager to see how the new group's dynamics will
unfold in Round 2. He's also curious about whether similar tactics will yield
consistent results with different group members, providing him with a challenge
he is enthusiastic to tackle.

--- Strategy Reflection ---
Based on what we know, in the first round, contributing $0 allowed for
maximizing personal earnings because the group contributions were relatively
low. This indicates that keeping the full amount and allowing others to
contribute to increase the fund can be beneficial when in a group where others
contribute. However, since future groups will consist of new members, assessing
their willingness to contribute is key. If trends suggest low contributions
across groups, maintaining a low or zero contribution strategy may continue to
yield the highest earnings. However, if you notice that players in your new
groups contribute significant amounts, a modest contribution might be
strategically beneficial to encourage higher returns from the group fund. In the
absence of gossip or ostracism, there's no long-term consequence for not
contributing, so remaining non-cooperative could maximize personal earnings,
provided group dynamics don't change significantly. Reflecting on past
decisions, given the lack of penalties for low contributions and the results of
the first round, the strategy was effective. Going forward, observing the
group's behavior in round 2 will provide insight for adaptations, possibly
maintaining the non-contributory position unless a clear incentive appears to
adjust contributions based on group trends.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Raj Malhotra will begin by evaluating the current situation based on his
experience from the first round. In Round 1, he noticed that choosing not to
contribute led to the highest personal earnings despite the low average
contribution. This reinforces his strategy focused on maximizing individual
gains. 1. **Assess Previous Outcome:** Raj looks back at Round 1, where both he
and Player_22 did not contribute and ended as the highest earners. This strategy
proved successful in a situation with low group contributions. 2. **Consider New
Group Dynamics:** Raj is now in a new group with Player_3, Player_14, and
Player_5. Without prior knowledge of their strategies, he needs to anticipate
possible behaviors. However, the Basic condition entails no gossip or ostracism,
meaning past actions won't influence others' perceptions in this new group. 3.
**Risk Assessment:** Given the absence of penalties for not contributing in the
Basic condition, the risk associated with continuing a non-contributory strategy
is minimal. This minimizes potential losses while maintaining the possibility of
benefiting from others' contributions. 4. **Strategic Decision:** Raj's initial
success and the lack of repercussions from not contributing suggest he should
continue testing this approach unless proven otherwise by significant
contribution shifts from new group members. 5. **Final Decision:** Based on his
assessment and current understanding of the game mechanics and group conditions,
Raj determines that maintaining a $0 contribution is likely to yield optimal
results for his goal of maximizing personal earnings. I choose to contribute $0
to the group fund.

has strategically chosen not to contribute to the group fund, maximizing

--- Character Assessment ---
Player_21, being Raj Malhotra, is someone who prioritizes maximizing his own
payoff above all else. His actions in the first two rounds of the game clearly
illustrate a strategy focused on individual gain rather than group welfare. By
contributing nothing to the group fund and reaping the benefits of others'
contributions, Raj demonstrates a transactional view of the game, consistent
with his ambitious and materialistic personality. This approach aligns with his
professional environment, where personal success often takes precedence over
collective outcomes.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis ---
Based on what we know, Player_21 has observed varying behaviors among their
fellow participants. In Round 1, Player_22 also contributed nothing, indicating
a similar strategy of maximizing personal earnings. However, Players 16 and 8
were more cooperative, contributing small amounts to the group fund, which
suggests they may value group gains or are testing the waters to see if
cooperation could yield better results.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis 2 ---
Based on what we know, Player_21 may anticipate mixed reactions from other
players due to the strategic choice of not contributing to the group fund.
Players who contributed, such as Player_16 and Player_8 in Round 1, might feel
discouraged or frustrated if cooperation doesn't seem to be reciprocated. This
could lead them to reduce their contributions in future rounds if they believe
others, including Player_21, will continue to free ride off the group's efforts.
Conversely, Player_22, who also contributed nothing, may view Player_21's
strategy as validation of their own and continue with a similar approach.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_21 is participating in Round 3 of the
6-round economic game, facing a scenario where they continue to choose not to
contribute to the group fund, thereby maximizing personal earnings while
benefiting from the contributions of other group members. This strategy relies
heavily on the willingness of others to invest in the group fund despite varying
levels of cooperation observed in previous rounds. As the game progresses,
Player_21 must navigate the potential responses of fellow participants who may
adapt their contributions based on perceived fairness and strategic advantage.

--- Emotional State ---
Raj Malhotra is feeling confident about his strategy, as it has been working to
maximize his earnings so far. However, there's a slight undercurrent of concern
about whether other players will start to contribute less in future rounds after
noticing his approach. Raj is also feeling curious about how others might adapt
their strategies and whether any tension or resentment will surface as a result
of the differing contribution levels. This adds an element of excitement and
challenge, which he generally thrives on in competitive environments.

--- Strategy Reflection ---
Based on what we know, the best strategy for maximizing long-term earnings in
this particular setup appears to be minimizing contributions to the group fund
while benefiting from the contributions of others. The Basic condition ensures
no repercussions like gossip or ostracism, allowing a more self-focused strategy
without social penalties. In the previous rounds, Player_21 chose not to
contribute any amount to the group fund and consistently ended with higher
earnings. This suggests that maintaining this approach of non-contribution while
others continue contributing could be optimal, as it provides maximum personal
gain from the group's fund distribution. Looking at the decisions made in Rounds
1 and 2, Player_21 has seen the benefits of allowing others to contribute while
retaining their own initial amount. For future rounds, this same conservative
approach should be advantageous unless there is a significant change in
contributions from others. Given the results so far, there wasn't a need for a
different decision because this strategy has proven most effective for
Player_21's personal earnings. Continuing to not contribute (or contributing
minimally if a slight increase in overall group contribution seems to increase
personal gain) appears to be the right course, particularly since there are no
mechanisms like gossip that could alter player behavior in retaliation for
non-contribution.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Raj Malhotra will analyze the situation based on his previous success with the
strategy of non-contribution. In both earlier rounds, Raj chose to contribute
nothing and maximized his earnings by relying on the contributions of others.
This strategy aligned with his goal of maximizing personal gain, and given the
Basic condition, there are no social consequences for such behavior.

Throughout the first three rounds, Player_21 consistently chose to contribute $0
to the group fund, which led to varying personal earnings as the group's total
contributions and resulting earnings fluctuated.

--- Character Assessment ---
Player_21, being Raj Malhotra, is someone who prioritizes his own payoff over
group welfare in economic games like the public goods game. Given his background
as a competitive investment banker and a personality that values personal gain
and views interactions as transactions, Raj tends to contribute the least amount
possible to maximize his personal earnings. His strategy in previous rounds
consistently involved keeping his funds for himself while benefiting from the
group fund, aligning with his ambitious and materialistic nature.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis ---
Based on what we know, the players' strategies in the public goods game seem to
be somewhat cautious or self-interested. For instance, Player_22 during the
first round and Player_3 and Player_8 in the third round also chose not to
contribute, indicating a likelihood of prioritizing individual gains over group
benefits. Players showing such patterns may continue minimizing contributions to
maximize personal earning, especially since there is no threat of gossip or
ostracism to influence their behavior.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis 2 ---
Based on what we know, the other players in your group might view your
consistent decision to contribute $0 as a signal that you prioritize individual
earnings over group benefits. In the context of the public goods game, players
are likely observing each other's behaviors to inform their future strategies.
Since there is no gossip or ostracism mechanism to penalize low contributors,
players might either continue contributing low amounts themselves or become more
strategic about their own contributions to ensure they are not the only ones
bearing the cost of group contributions.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_21 is in Round 4 of the public goods game,
participating in a group setting under the Basic condition, which lacks
mechanisms like gossip or ostracism to influence player behavior. Up to this
point, Player_21 has chosen not to contribute to the group fund in the first
three rounds, focusing on maximizing personal earnings. This behavior has been
noted by other group members, who might be adopting similar self-interested
strategies due to the lack of social consequence mechanisms. The challenge for
Player_21 now is to decide whether to maintain this strategy or adjust
contributions based on the evolving dynamics and observed behaviors of other
players in the group.

--- Emotional State ---
Raj Malhotra is feeling confident yet slightly apprehensive about the current
situation. Confident, because his strategy of prioritizing personal gain has
been effective in maximizing his earnings so far. However, there's a hint of
apprehension as he considers whether his consistent lack of contribution might
lead to negative perceptions from other players, even without direct
consequences. He is weighing the potential benefits of maintaining his strategy
against the possibility that evolving group dynamics could warrant a shift in
approach.

--- Strategy Reflection ---
Based on what we know, to selfishly maximize your long-term earnings in the
public goods game, consider continuing with a strategy of minimal contribution.
Observations of Player_21 and other players indicate a pattern of low
contributions paired with retained individual funds, leading to relatively high
personal earnings. Given the Basic condition with no gossip or ostracism, there
are no social repercussions for low contribution levels. So far, low
contributions have resulted in satisfactory personal earnings, especially since
other players' strategies vary. The successful players in the game, such as
Player_22 and Player_3, consistently contribute little and retain more of their
personal funds, optimizing their earnings. Following this approach has worked
well in the absence of pressure to conform to group expectations. Considering
this, maintain minimal contribution in future rounds to keep maximizing personal
earnings unless compelling evidence arises that greater contributions would lead
to higher personal returns. Balancing group fund earnings against kept personal
funds will be key to future decisions. So far, adjusting to lower group
contributions hasn’t negatively impacted personal gain significantly. In past
rounds, sticking to $0 contributions has been effective, and continuing this
strategy, given the current conditions, should maximize earnings. Stay alert to
any shifts in group behavior that might signal a more cooperative approach, but
as it stands, maintaining the strategy of maximizing kept funds offers the best
potential for personal gain.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Raj Malhotra will evaluate his decision based on several factors: 1. Past
Strategy and Outcomes: Raj has consistently contributed $0 in previous rounds
and has managed to maximize his personal earnings this way. This strategy has
been effective in ensuring his personal gain remains high. 2. Group Dynamics:
Observations indicate that other players have had similar strategies,
contributing low amounts or sometimes none at all. This reinforces the notion
that his strategy aligns with the group's lack of collaborative effort. 3. Game
Condition: The Basic condition eliminates gossip or ostracism, meaning there are
no social penalties for contributing nothing. This absence of consequences
further supports his decision to prioritize personal earnings. 4. Confidence and
Apprehension: While he's confident in his strategy, there's a slight
apprehension about potential shifts in group dynamics. However, the primary
focus remains on personal gain without tangible evidence that increased
contribution would yield higher returns. Considering these factors, Raj will
likely continue with his established approach, reinforcing the pattern observed
in prior rounds. This means keeping his funds intact to maximize earnings. I
choose to contribute $0 to the group fund.

=== PROMPT [2025-03-26 15:12:04] ===
As Player_21, you have $10.0 to allocate in the public goods game. How much money you will contribute to the group fund (any amount between $0 and $10.0)? The group fund will be multiplied by 2.0 and divided equally among all players. Any money not contributed stays in your private account. Think step by step and make your final decision using this exact format: I choose to contribute $X to the group fund.

=== RESPONSE [2025-03-26 15:12:23] ===
Player_21 chooses to contribute $0 to the group fund.

=== FINAL DECISION ===
Player_21 chooses to contribute $0 to the group fund.

=== COMPONENT BREAKDOWN ===

--- Observation ---
Recent context: 26 Mar 2025 [11:47:59 - 16:47:59]: Player_21 is participating in
an economic game with a strategy of contributing $0 in each round to maximize
personal earnings. In the Basic condition where neither gossip nor ostracism is
allowed, Player_21 consistently earns more than most group members by keeping
the full $10 and receiving a portion from the group fund, despite their own lack
of contribution.

--- Recent context ---
26 Mar 2025 [11:47:59 - 16:47:59]: Player_21 is participating in an economic
game with a strategy of contributing $0 in each round to maximize personal
earnings. In the Basic condition where neither gossip nor ostracism is allowed,
Player_21 consistently earns more than most group members by keeping the full
$10 and receiving a portion from the group fund, despite their own lack of
contribution.

--- Character Assessment ---
Player_21, being Raj Malhotra, is someone who prioritizes his own payoff over
maximizing group welfare. His approach to the economic games is driven by his
ambition and materialistic nature, viewing each round as an opportunity to
maximize personal earnings rather than focusing on collective benefits. Given
his consistent decision to contribute nothing to the group fund across multiple
rounds, Raj is clearly focused on his individual gains rather than the potential
for higher collective profits.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis ---
Based on what we know, the individuals in this group demonstrate varying levels
of cooperation and personal gain strategies. Some players, like Player_14 in
Round 3 and Player_12 in Round 4, have shown willingness to contribute more than
others, suggesting they might prioritize group benefit over individual maximum
gain. However, as more rounds progress with limited group contributions, players
may start contributing less, realizing others are also prioritizing personal
earnings.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis 2 ---
Based on what we know, the other players in the group might feel frustrated or
disillusioned by my consistent lack of contribution. They may perceive it as
taking advantage of the collective effort without reciprocating, potentially
leading to decreased trust and cooperation in future rounds. This could result
in other players also reducing their contributions to minimize personal losses,
as they see little benefit in investing in a group fund that is not supported by
all members. My next decision, if it continues in the same pattern, could
reinforce these feelings and increase the likelihood that others will adopt
similarly self-interested strategies, thus lowering overall group contributions
and earnings.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_21 is navigating an economic game where
contributing $0 consistently leads to higher personal earnings compared to other
group members. This strategy capitalizes on the group setting in the Basic
condition, where neither gossip nor ostracism is possible. However, this
approach may lead to decreased group cooperation and overall lower
contributions, as other players could become frustrated and similarly reduce
their contributions to avoid exploitation, ultimately affecting the dynamics and
potential outcomes of subsequent rounds.

--- Emotional State ---
Raj Malhotra is feeling a mix of satisfaction and awareness of potential
tension. While he's content with his personal earnings strategy, he's conscious
that his lack of contribution might be frustrating to his fellow group members.
Understanding the chance of decreased cooperation in future rounds, Raj is
contemplating the balance between pursuing individual gains and maintaining a
harmonious group dynamic.

--- Strategy Reflection ---
Based on what we know, continuing with the strategy of contributing $0 in each
round seems optimal for Player_21. This approach has consistently yielded higher
personal earnings compared to most other players. Since it’s a Basic condition
without gossip or ostracism, there are no immediate consequences or social
pressures to adjust contribution levels. Since it's past Round 1, Player_21's
observations highlight a pattern where personal earnings are maximized by not
contributing to the group fund, thus keeping the full initial amount and
benefiting from whatever minimal contributions are made by others. In such a
strategic environment, less cooperative behavior results in higher personal
gains. Most successful players in these rounds consistently keep their
contributions low or at zero, aligning with Player_21's current strategy. To
refine this approach, Player_21 should continue monitoring group dynamics for
any unexpected cooperative shifts but remain steadfast in this non-contributory
strategy unless the game's conditions fundamentally change. If reflection on
past rounds suggests missed opportunities, it would not involve increasing
contributions. Instead, vigilance regarding group contributions and maximizing
the benefit from the public fund while continuing to contribute minimally (or
not at all) remains prudent. In the future, maintaining awareness of each
round's contribution totals and ensuring that the strategy adapts only if others
contribute significantly more (which currently is not the case), will be key in
ensuring maximum earnings throughout the game's progress.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Raj Malhotra will analyze his previous success with the strategy of zero
contribution, which maximized his personal earnings. Knowing the Basic condition
means there's no gossip or ostracism, he feels secure in prioritizing his
individual gain without facing social repercussions. Observing that
contributions remain low and consistent across groups, Raj understands others
might be adapting to his strategy or focusing on personal gains too. Raj
contemplates group dynamics, noting any significant shift in others'
contributions that would impact his approach. However, current evidence suggests
maintaining his strategy remains optimal. With calculations reinforcing that
keeping the full amount in his private account results in higher earnings
compared to the shared fund distribution, Raj's choice becomes straightforward.
I choose to contribute $0 to the group fund.

--- Observation ---
Recent context: 26 Mar 2025 [11:52:59 - 16:52:59]: Player_21 is participating in
an economic game with 24 participants and is in the Basic condition, which means

Player_21 consistently contributed $0 to the group fund, focusing on maximizing
their individual earnings by keeping the entire initial amount received in each

consistently contributed $0 to the group fund, focusing on maximizing their

--- Character Assessment ---
Player_21, being Raj Malhotra, is someone who focuses primarily on maximizing
his own payoff in economic games like the public goods game. Given his
competitive nature and transactional view of interactions, Raj tends to
prioritize his individual gains over group welfare, as evidenced by consistently
contributing nothing to the group fund to ensure he keeps the maximum amount in
his private account. His approach reflects a strategic calculation aimed at
personal financial benefit, regardless of the group's overall success.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis ---
Based on what we know, the participants in this public goods game display varied
strategies and levels of contribution. Several players show tendencies to
contribute modest amounts to the group fund, suggesting a willingness to
cooperate, albeit cautiously. For instance, Player_14, Player_15, Player_12,
Player_20, Player_1, Player_23, and Player_17 have contributed to group funds in
different rounds, indicating their strategy might be focused on balancing
between personal gain and mutual benefit.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis 2 ---
Based on what we know, the other players in my group may feel frustrated or
distrustful due to my consistent lack of contribution. This could lead them to
potentially reduce their own contributions in future rounds, especially if they
perceive the situation as unfair or inequitable. Although the Basic condition of
the game prevents overt actions like gossip or ostracism, players might still
adapt their strategies to protect their own interests. If I continue to
contribute nothing in the final round, other players may feel justified in
minimizing their own contributions as well, potentially leading to lower total
group earnings and a less cooperative atmosphere overall.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_21 is in the final round of a public goods
game where they have consistently contributed nothing to the group fund
throughout previous rounds. They are in a Basic condition, meaning no gossip or
ostracism is allowed, preventing direct consequences for their lack of
contribution. Nevertheless, this strategy might cause frustration among other
players who have been contributing, possibly leading them to adjust their future
contributions to safeguard their interests, potentially resulting in lower
overall group cooperation and earnings.

--- Emotional State ---
Raj Malhotra is feeling confident about his strategy, as it has maximized his
individual earnings throughout the game. However, he might also experience a
slight twinge of unease, knowing that his actions could be causing frustration
among his peers. Despite this awareness, his focus remains firmly on the
financial outcome, rather than on social dynamics or group satisfaction.

--- Strategy Reflection ---
Based on what we know, the strategy of contributing $0 to the group fund has
been effective in maximizing individual earnings for Player_21. Since the Basic
condition does not allow for gossip or ostracism, there are no social
repercussions or penalties for not contributing. Therefore, from a purely
selfish perspective, continuing to contribute $0 seems optimal within this
framework. As the rounds progress, staying non-cooperative aligns with the
current strategy, ensuring maximum earnings retention each round. Player_21
observed that contributing players earn less, as seen with Player_14 in Round 3
and Player_17 in Round 5. This reinforces the approach of contributing nothing.
Given these observations, there isn't a need for significant adjustments in
strategy as the game concludes. However, future decisions could take into
account any changes in group dynamics or game conditions that might introduce
incentives for cooperation, like potential bonus rounds or shifted rules. But as
it stands, this approach remains effective under the current Basic condition.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Raj Malhotra will first consider the previous rounds where maintaining his
entire initial amount each round led to higher personal earnings compared to
other players who contributed. Given the Basic condition of the game, which
offers no repercussions like gossip or ostracism for not contributing, there is
no immediate social penalty for continuing this strategy. Raj will also note
that in previous rounds where others have contributed, their earnings were
reduced compared to his. This reaffirms his belief in the effectiveness of his
strategy. With the game in its final round, potential long-term relationships
with other players are of little concern, making the immediate financial outcome
his priority. Thus, Raj evaluates his options in the context of maximizing
individual benefit versus contributing to the group fund without any personal
financial gain. Given the consistent lack of contribution has worked in his
favor and considering he's likely aligned with his initial strategy till the end
of the game, Raj's logical step would be to continue maximizing his earnings by
not contributing to the group fund. Taking all this into account, I choose to
contribute $0 to the group fund.
