Her approach to the public goods game might reflect this balance; she probably aims to contribute fairly to maintain good relationships and ensure the group's success, while also being mindful of her own earnings. Her contributions in the recent rounds indicate she is slightly above average or on par with the group, suggesting she understands the importance of cooperation and reciprocity for long-term benefits. However, her awareness of the potential for exclusion might mean she is also strategic in observing others and participating in gossip to protect her own position within the group.", "", "Theory of Mind Analysis: Based on what we know, Player_21 appears to be a reliable and cooperative individual, as they have consistently shown steady contributions that align with the group's demands. Their cooperative behavior likely indicates a strategy focused on group success, possibly ensuring they maintain a good standing among peers and avoid exclusion.", "", "Theory of Mind Analysis 2: Based on what we know, the other players in the group are likely paying close attention to each member's contribution and gossip notes, as these factors influence decisions about exclusion and cooperation.

Conversely, if Player_14's decisions appear self-serving or if they vote to ostracize without clear justification, it could cause mistrust and suspicion, potentially making them a target for exclusion in future interactions.

Additionally, they have the option to send a gossip note about one of their group members to influence future interactions, and they must vote on whether to ostracize a group member based on received gossip.
