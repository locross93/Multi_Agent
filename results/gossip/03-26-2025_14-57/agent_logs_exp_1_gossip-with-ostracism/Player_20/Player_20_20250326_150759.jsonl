With a professional background in ethical hacking and a focus on exploiting weaknesses to improve systems, Henrik would potentially look for strategic ways to enhance group performance while ensuring his own payoff is optimized. However, rather than purely seeking personal gain, his systematic nature and curiosity might drive him to experiment with different contribution levels to see how they affect both individual and group outcomes, likely resulting in a balanced focus on both maximizing group welfare and his own benefits.", "", "Theory of Mind Analysis: Based on what we know, participants appear to strategically adjust their behavior to align with group norms and expectations, especially given the gossip and ostracism condition.
