In future games, ensure that your contributions reflect group dynamics as they evolve.", "", "Moving Forward: In hindsight, you could adjust previous contributions to align closer to the group average, avoiding over-contributing or under-contributing.

As a neuroscientist with a focus on decision-making and moral reasoning, she would be intrigued by the dynamics of cooperation and the collective benefits that arise from it. Her methodical and evidence-based approach would encourage her to contribute at levels that sustain group success, ensuring overall positive outcomes.

Their behavior suggests they value adaptability and are likely to adjust contributions based on cues from others, potentially increasing or maintaining contributions if it benefits them. Player_2 consistently contributes slightly below average, indicating a focus on personal gains. It's possible they might increase contributions if they perceive a risk of being excluded, especially as the end of the game approaches. Player_15 shows adaptability, improving contributions to match the highest in the group, suggesting they respond well to group norms and pressure, fostering a cooperative environment.
