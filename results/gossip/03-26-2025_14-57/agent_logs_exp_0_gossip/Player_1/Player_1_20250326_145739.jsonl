Moving forward, adjust your contribution to position yourself as a reliable but slightly self-interested player, optimizing personal profits while maintaining group functionality.", "", "5. **Reputation Management**: Use the gossip mechanism strategically to subtly reinforce your favorable standing among future partners.
