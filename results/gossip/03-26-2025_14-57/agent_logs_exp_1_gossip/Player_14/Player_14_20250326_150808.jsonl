Since she has no prior observations of this group's behavior, sticking close to the average may be wise.", "", "4. **Evaluate Risks and Rewards**: She needs to balance her contribution to leverage the group fund's multiplier effectively, without losing out on personal earnings.", "", "5. **Consider the Final Round Context**: With no fear of ostracism (as there's no further rounds), her current contribution will not affect future interactions, but it will affect her final outcome in this game.", "", "Given these considerations, Lucia aims to contribute enough to foster group efficiency but retain a significant portion for her private account. Considering an average past contribution slightly below $6.0 and given that the multiplier of the group fund is beneficial, a contribution around this amount would align well with her goal of balancing group welfare and personal gain.", "", "Based on her past strategic behavior and its outcomes, I choose to contribute $6.0 to the group fund.", "", "Exercise: As Player_14, you have $10.0 to allocate in the public goods game.
