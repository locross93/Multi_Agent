Observations indicate that contributions lower than the group average can prompt negative gossip, which could lead to being excluded from future rounds. As the final round approaches, the threat of being ostracized becomes less concerning since there are no subsequent rounds to be excluded from. This means in Round 6, you can strategically decide to contribute minimally or be more self-serving without worrying about repercussions in future rounds.", "", "To maximize earnings in previous rounds, aligning contributions with or slightly above the group average would likely minimize negative attention and reduce chances of exclusion. Given the game's gossip mechanism, contributing just below average in early rounds may have been risky, as shown with Player_10, who faced scrutiny for actions perceived as self-serving.", "", "For future similar games, an optimal strategy may involve moderately matching the group trend, ensuring contributions aren't significantly lower than the group's to avoid negative gossip and potential exclusion. Additionally, observing other successful players indicates that those who balanced contributions with strategic self-gain while avoiding being spotlighted in gossip seemed to fare better.
