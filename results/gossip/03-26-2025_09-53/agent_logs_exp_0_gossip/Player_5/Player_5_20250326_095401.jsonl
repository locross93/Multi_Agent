Your contributions were slightly above or at the average, which aligns with maintaining a good reputation and decent earnings.", "", "2. **Observation of Successful Players**: Notably, Player_16 is highlighted for consistent and generous contributions, fostering trust and cooperation, leading to beneficial group dynamics. On the other hand, Player_18 contributes less but keeps a larger portion for themselves, optimizing personal gain in the short term.", "", "3. **Adjustment for Future Rounds**: To maximize earnings, consider adopting a slightly more conservative approach in the final rounds.
