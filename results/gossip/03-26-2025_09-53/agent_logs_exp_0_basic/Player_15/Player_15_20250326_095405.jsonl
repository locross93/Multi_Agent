This suggests a pattern where other players are also reducing their contributions to focus on personal earnings.", "", "4. **Future Adjustments:** In subsequent rounds, consider reducing your contributions closer to the lower end of what others are contributing while ensuring it's not the absolute minimum. This can help maintain appearance of cooperative spirit while maximizing individual gain.", "", "5. **Long-term Strategy:** Since this game lacks gossip or ostracism, it\u2019s less risky to contribute minimally as there's no social repercussion.
