This suggests that he'll prioritize group cooperation and ensure that everyone benefits to some extent, balancing between contributing to the group fund and safeguarding his own earnings in the economic game.", "", "Theory of Mind Analysis: Based on what we know, Player_19's behavior suggests a tendency to prioritize self-gain over group success, as seen by their $0 contribution in the latest round while reaping maximum benefit from the group fund. This pattern could indicate a strategic hold-back to maximize personal profit, possibly attempting to avoid suspicion by aligning with the average contribution in past rounds but then opting out in this crucial moment. Their past behavior of contributing less than the group average supports this analysis. Unless ostracized or pressured by notes, they might continue or even amplify this strategy in future rounds. Player_17, having also contributed $4 previously, seems similarly cautious about contributing more than the necessary minimum, though they increased to $6 in the recent round. This shift might indicate an adaptation due to gossip pressures, demonstrating a willingness to align closer to group norms if they perceive risk to their participation. Player_6 appears consistent, cooperative, with stable contributions aligning with or slightly above the average, aiming to balance cooperation with personal gain. As the rounds progress, strategic adjustments may occur depending on the feedback and gossip each player receives. Given the \"Gossip with ostracism\" condition, players who consistently under-contribute or those directly criticized in notes might increase their contributions to avoid exclusion, especially if aware that prior rounds have put them under scrutiny. This social pressure could lead to a more synchronized effort among group members once initial strategies based on individualistic gain begin to threaten their inclusion in future earnings.", "", "Theory of Mind Analysis 2: Based on what we know, the other players in my group might perceive my decision to contribute $6 favorably, as it aligns with the higher contributions in the group and shows a commitment to group success.

They are in the \"Gossip with ostracism\" condition, which allows for sending anonymous notes about fellow players' contributions. Player_8 needs to consider the balance between maximizing personal and group earnings while avoiding exclusion based on gossip. In the latest round, Player_8 contributed $6, aligning with others in their group except for Player_19, who contributed nothing and thus benefited disproportionately from the group fund.
