This person may adjust their contributions based on group dynamics or external influence, but further encouragement to focus on group success could foster consistent cooperation.

It's possible they may increase their contributions with positive reinforcement or strategic persuasion from peers. Lastly, Player_11 has consistently contributed less and appears to prioritize their own earnings.
