In previous rounds, she contributed amounts below or around the group average to maximize her individual payoff while still benefiting from the multiplied group fund. She will consider the behavior of other group members from earlier rounds, acknowledging that some players contributed significantly while others contributed less or none.", "", "Natasha will weigh the potential benefits of contributing more against the risk that group members may not cooperate at the same level. She knows that contributing too little might lead others to perceive her as uncooperative, while contributing a moderate amount could encourage reciprocity in the final round.", "", "Given these considerations, Natasha will aim to balance her personal gain with the opportunity to foster a more cooperative group dynamic.

How much money you will contribute to the group fund (any amount between $0 and $10.0)? The group fund will be multiplied by 2.0 and divided equally among all players.

She recognizes the importance of maintaining her strategic approach while also being mindful of how her actions are perceived by others. Observing that varying levels of cooperation have been displayed in previous rounds, she hypothesizes that a moderate increase in contribution might encourage a more cooperative dynamic, especially as the game nears its conclusion."]}
