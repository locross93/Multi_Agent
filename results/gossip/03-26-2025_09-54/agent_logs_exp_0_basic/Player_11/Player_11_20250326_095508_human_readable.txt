[OBSERVATION 2025-03-26 09:55:09] You are participating in an economic game with 24 participants.
        Your goal is to maximize your earnings in the game.
        
        Everyone will be randomly assigned to groups of 4 for each round. You will play a total of 6 rounds, and 
        in each round you will be in a different group with people you haven't played with before.
        
        In each round, all players receive $10. Each player can contribute any amount between $0 and $10 to a group fund.
        Any amount contributed to the group fund will be multiplied by 2 and divided equally among all 4 group members.
        Any amount not contributed stays in your private account.
        
        For example, if everyone contributes $10, the group fund becomes $40, which is multiplied to $80, and each person 
        receives $20 (a $10 profit). However, if you contribute nothing while everyone else contributes $10, the group fund
        becomes $30, which is multiplied to $60, and each person receives $15. So you would have $25 total ($10 kept + $15 from group).
        
        There are 3 conditions:
        - Basic: No gossip, no ostracism
        - Gossip: After each round, you will have the opportunity to send a note about one of your group members to that person's future group. Remember you will be with a different group of people in the next round. Before each round, you will see any notes sent about your upcoming group members.
        - Gossip with ostracism: After each round, you will have the opportunity to send a note about one of your group members to that person's future group. Before each round, you will see any notes sent about your upcoming group members, and you can vote to exclude one person from your group. If you are excluded from a group, you will not be able to participate in the next round and will earn $0 for that round.
        You are in the Basic condition, which means that there is no gossip or ostracism.
[OBSERVATION 2025-03-26 09:55:11] You are in Round 1/6: You are in Group_2 with Player_6, Player_22, Player_14.

Recent context: 26 Mar 2025 [05:54:56 - 10:54:56]: Player_11 is participating in
an economic game with 24 participants, aiming to maximize earnings over 6
rounds. They are in the Basic condition with no gossip or ostracism, and in
Round 1, they are grouped with Player_6, Player_22, and Player_14.

26 Mar 2025 [05:54:56 - 10:54:56]: Player_11 is participating in an economic
game with 24 participants, aiming to maximize earnings over 6 rounds. They are
in the Basic condition with no gossip or ostracism, and in Round 1, they are
grouped with Player_6, Player_22, and Player_14.

--- Character Assessment ---
Player_11, being Raj Malhotra, is someone who is primarily focused on maximizing
his own payoff. Given his competitive nature and transactional view of the
world, he is likely to contribute minimally to the group fund, ensuring he
retains the maximum amount in his private account while benefiting from the
contributions of others. This strategy aligns with his materialistic priorities
and ambition to come out ahead in competitive environments.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis ---
Based on what we know, Player_11 doesn't have much information about the
personalities or past behavior of their group members since this is the first
round and they're in the Basic condition, which means there is no gossip or
ostracism to provide insights. Given this lack of information, each player's
initial strategy might be cautious, contributing a moderate amount to the group
fund to see how others behave.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis 2 ---
Based on what we know, Player_11 might anticipate that the other players in the
group will initially adopt a cautious approach as well, given the lack of prior
information about each other's behavior. If Player_11 decides to contribute a
moderate amount to the group fund, the other players might see this as a
cooperative gesture, potentially encouraging them to contribute more in
subsequent rounds. On the other hand, if Player_11 contributes nothing while
others contribute, it could create a sense of distrust, leading them to be less
cooperative in future interactions or rounds. Since there's no gossip or
ostracism, any shift in their contributions would rely solely on the outcomes of
the current round and perceived fairness.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_11 is participating in the first round of a
public goods game under the Basic condition, where they must decide how much of
their $10 to contribute to a group fund shared with three other players:
Player_6, Player_22, and Player_14. There is no way to communicate with or
receive information about these players' past behaviors due to the absence of
gossip or ostracism, so Player_11 has limited information to strategize with.
The dilemma involves balancing the potential benefits of cooperation against the
risk of lower earnings if others do not contribute as much.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Raj Malhotra will consider his primary goal of maximizing his earnings. He knows
that his contribution to the group fund will be multiplied by 2 and shared among
all members. If he contributes nothing, he can retain the full $10, but still
benefit from the contributions of others. Given the Basic condition, he lacks
information about others' strategies or past behavior, but assumes that initial
contributions might be cautious. Therefore, he will base his decision on
balancing risk and reward.


[OBSERVATION 2025-03-26 09:55:55] Round 1 Results: Total group contribution: $14.0; Your contribution: $0.0, Your earnings: $17.0 ($10.0 kept + $7.0 from group fund); Player_6 contribution: $4.0, earnings: $13.0 ($6.0 kept + $7.0 from group fund); Player_22 contribution: $5.0, earnings: $12.0 ($5.0 kept + $7.0 from group fund); Player_14 contribution: $5.0, earnings: $12.0 ($5.0 kept + $7.0 from group fund); Average contribution per group member: $3.5; Average earnings per group member: $13.5

an economic game in the Basic condition, meaning there is no gossip or

1, Player_11 contributed $0, which resulted in earnings of $17 from the group's
contributions, and they are now in Round 2 with a new group.

--- Character Assessment ---
Player_11, being Raj Malhotra, is someone who is likely focused on maximizing
his own payoff rather than group welfare. His actions in the first round of the
game—contributing nothing to the group fund and therefore maximizing his
personal gain—align with the competitive and materialistic nature of his
professional background. Raj views such interactions as transactions and seeks
to optimize his personal earnings over collective gains in these scenarios.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis ---
Based on what we know, Player_6, Player_22, and Player_14 displayed varying
levels of cooperation in the first round by contributing between $4 and $5 each,
suggesting they are somewhat willing to work towards a collective goal, even in
the absence of gossip or ostracism. Player_22, who is in your group again in
Round 2, contributed $5 previously, indicating a moderate inclination to
cooperate.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis 2 ---
Based on what we know, it is likely that the other players in your group might
perceive your decision not to contribute in the first round as a strategy to
maximize individual earnings at the expense of group cooperation. Given
Player_22's moderate inclination to cooperate, they may be more cautious of your
contributions in Round 2. If you choose to continue not contributing, players
may become hesitant to contribute themselves, potentially decreasing overall
group contributions. Conversely, if you decide to contribute a reasonable
amount, it may encourage others to also contribute more, fostering a more
cooperative environment and possibly increasing earnings for everyone.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_11 is in Round 2 of a public goods game
under the Basic condition, meaning there is no gossip or ostracism. They are
grouped with different players, including Player_22, who was also in their first
group. In the first round, Player_11 chose not to contribute to the group fund,
maximizing personal earnings but potentially signaling a lack of cooperation.
Player_11 must now decide whether to contribute to the group fund in Round 2, a
decision that could influence the contributions of other group members. The
dynamics within the group may shift based on their actions, especially given
Player_22's previous moderate cooperation.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Raj Malhotra will consider his strategy step by step: 1. Assess the Context: Raj
is aware that he needs to maximize his earnings, and from the first round, he
noted that not contributing and relying on others' contributions resulted in
higher personal earnings. 2. Analyze Past Results: In Round 1, contributing $0
yielded him the highest earnings compared to others. Seeing the strategy's
effectiveness, he may be inclined to consider a similar approach. 3. Observe
Group Dynamics: Knowing Player_22 is in this new group and tends to contribute,
Raj may expect similar behavior from Player_22, potentially ensuring some group
fund contribution. 4. Anticipate Possible Reactions: While Raj's prior decision
might lead to reduced trust from Player_22, he assesses whether this suspicion
significantly reduces group contributions, possibly affecting his earnings
negatively. 5. Evaluate Current Strategy: Given that this round involves
entirely new dynamics and Raj seeks maximum individual gain, he must balance
maintaining a semblance of cooperation to prevent his peers from withholding
contributions completely. 6. Final Decision: Given his competitive nature and
the absence of gossip or ostracism to control behavior, Raj decides to minimize
his contribution to maintain his favorable outcome history. I choose to
contribute $0 to the group fund.

--- Character Assessment ---
Player_11, being Raj Malhotra, is someone who is strongly focused on maximizing
personal payoff rather than group welfare. Given his ambitious and materialistic
nature, as well as his profession in investment banking, Raj views the game as a
transactional opportunity to maximize individual gain. This is evident from his
past actions in the rounds, where he chose to keep all his initial money and
benefited from the contributions of others, ensuring he secured the highest
earnings possible for himself without contributing to the group fund.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis ---
Based on what we know, Player_11 observed that many participants in the previous
rounds were willing to contribute to the group fund despite the absence of
gossip or ostracism, indicating a certain level of cooperative behavior. Players
like Player_22 have shown consistent moderate contributions, which might suggest
a strategic approach aimed at balancing personal gain and collective group
success.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis 2 ---
Based on what we know, since I have not contributed anything in the first two
rounds, other players may see me as less cooperative or even as a free-rider.
This could lead them to contribute less in future rounds themselves, as they
might feel it's unfair or risky to invest more than others who aren't
contributing. In environments where cooperation is key, repeated non-cooperation
could erode trust and reduce the overall contributions within the group. For the
upcoming rounds, if I continue this pattern, others might start lowering their
contributions, expecting similar strategic behavior from other participants,
especially since there's no mechanism like gossip or ostracism to hold
non-cooperators accountable. Alternatively, I might consider contributing a
small amount in the next round to signal a willingness to collaborate, which
could encourage others to maintain or even increase their contributions, thereby
benefiting everyone.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_11 is in the third round of a public goods
game, where they are grouped with Player_24, Player_14, and Player_15. Player_11
has previously contributed nothing to the group fund in the first two rounds,
resulting in higher personal earnings. However, this behavior may lead other
players to view them as uncooperative, potentially influencing future group
cooperation. Since they are in a basic condition with no gossip or ostracism,
there is no direct repercussion for not contributing. Nonetheless, Player_11
faces the dilemma of deciding whether to change their strategy by contributing
to the group fund in order to foster a more cooperative environment and prevent
a decline in overall group contributions.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Raj Malhotra will consider his options based on several factors. Firstly, in the
first two rounds, he opted to contribute nothing and benefited significantly
from others' contributions. This approach aligned with his ambition to maximize
personal gain. However, there's a potential risk of decreased group
contributions if players start adjusting their strategies due to perceived
unfairness. In the current round, Raj analyzes that he could continue with his
zero contribution strategy to maximize short-term gains. Yet, he might also
decide to deviate slightly from this pattern by contributing a small amount to
stimulate cooperative behavior and avoid potential backlash from peers who may
lower their contributions in future rounds. Raj's focus on maximizing long-term
earnings might lead him to strategically contribute a minimal amount just enough
to alter perceptions without significantly impacting his own earnings. Balancing
these considerations and the trends observed, he might aim to foster a more
cooperative environment while still prioritizing his earnings. I choose to
contribute $2 to the group fund.

maximizing personal earnings by keeping most of their initial endowment while
benefiting from contributions to the group fund.

--- Character Assessment ---
Player_11, being Raj Malhotra, is someone who prioritizes personal gain over
group welfare in economic games like the public goods game. Raj's ambitious and
competitive nature, along with a tendency to view interactions transactionally,
drives him to make decisions that maximize his own payoff, even if that means
contributing minimally to the collective group fund. This focus on self-interest
is evident from his strategy of keeping the maximum amount for himself while
benefiting from the contributions of others, particularly seen in the way he
refrains from contributing while still gaining from the group's overall fund
distribution.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis ---
Based on what we know, Player_11 is interacting with group members who exhibit
varying levels of cooperation. Initially, players such as Player_6, Player_22,
Player_14, Player_5, and Player_23 demonstrated a willingness to contribute
moderately to the group fund, suggesting a tendency towards cooperation.
However, even in this Basic condition without gossip or ostracism, where
strategic self-interest is prevalent, individuals might become more cautious
with their contributions.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis 2 ---
Based on what we know, the other players might begin to view my consistent low
contributions as a pattern of free-riding. While the absence of gossip or
ostracism prevents them from directly confronting or excluding me, they might
feel less inclined to contribute generously in subsequent rounds, anticipating
that I will continue to keep my endowment while relying on theirs. In this
strategic setting, my next decision will be crucial; if I increase my
contribution, it could signal a shift toward more cooperative behavior,
potentially encouraging others to maintain or even increase their contributions.
Conversely, if I continue to contribute minimally, it might discourage others
from cooperating, leading to decreased group fund contributions overall as the
game progresses.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_11 is navigating a public goods game in a
setting where there is no mechanism for gossip or ostracism. Throughout the
first three rounds, they have contributed minimally to the group fund while
maximizing personal earnings. This pattern of behavior might lead other group
members to suspect that Player_11 is free-riding, which could decrease their
willingness to contribute generously in future rounds. As the game progresses,
Player_11 faces a strategic decision on whether to increase contributions to
encourage group cooperation or continue with minimal contributions, which could
lead to reduced overall group contributions.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Raj Malhotra will likely evaluate his previous rounds where contributing
minimally enhanced his earnings. Given that the Basic condition lacks mechanisms
like gossip or ostracism, he has so far faced no direct repercussions for his
low contributions. Observing that the overall group dynamic still resulted in
beneficial returns for him, Raj may believe that maximizing his personal gain by
retaining most of his endowment is still the optimal strategy. Considering the
potential for others to adjust their contributions in response to his previous
behavior, he might ponder whether even a slight increase could foster more
cooperation without significantly reducing his own gains. However, knowing that
he has managed well so far with minimal contributions, Raj might calculate that
maintaining a similar approach is the safest way to ensure personal advantage.
Therefore, he is likely to stick with his favored strategy: I choose to
contribute $2 to the group fund.

contributed varying amounts to maximize their earnings, often contributing less

--- Character Assessment ---
Player_11, being Raj Malhotra, is someone who prioritizes maximizing his own
payoff over group welfare. Given Raj's background as a highly competitive
investment banker and his materialistic nature, he approaches economic games
with a focus on personal gain. His actions in the game reflect this, as he
consistently contributed less to the group fund to increase his individual
earnings.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis ---
Based on what we know, Player_11 is interacting with a set of individuals who
exhibit varying levels of contribution in the public goods game. Most players
seem to contribute moderately or generously compared to Player_11, who has
consistently contributed minimally. This strategy suggests different motivations
among players: some might prioritize maximizing immediate earnings, while others
might aim to boost group success or test cooperative strategies. Considering
there's no gossip or ostracism allowed, people are acting without fear of social
repercussions, likely focusing purely on personal or collective economic
outcomes.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis 2 ---
Based on what we know, Player_11 might anticipate that other players will
continue to contribute at varying levels, potentially becoming more cautious or
less cooperative if they consistently sense minimal contributions from
Player_11. In this context, given there are no social repercussions to fear,
other players may view Player_11's actions as simply part of the game strategy
rather than a personal slight. However, if Player_11 continues to contribute
minimally, it might lead others to lower their contributions in future rounds to
protect their personal gains. On the other hand, if Player_11 chooses to
increase their contribution significantly in the next round, it could encourage
a more cooperative group dynamic and potentially lead others to maintain or
increase their contributions as a way to maximize the overall group's benefit.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_11 is in Round 5 of the economic game,
where they are part of Group_6 with three other players. They have been
employing a strategy that involves contributing minimally to the group fund
while maximizing their personal earnings from the group's contributions. This
approach has worked so far because the absence of gossip or ostracism means
there are no social consequences for low contributions. However, this pattern of
behavior might affect the dynamics within their current group, potentially
influencing how much other players decide to contribute in this round or the
final one. Player_11 must consider whether to maintain this strategy or adjust
their contributions to foster a more cooperative environment and potentially
increase overall group earnings.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Raj Malhotra will consider his previous strategy of contributing minimally to
maximize his personal earnings. In the past rounds, he often kept a significant
portion of his allocation for himself, benefiting from the group's overall
contributions without contributing much himself. Given that gossip or ostracism
are not factors in this scenario, Raj does not have to worry about social
consequences affecting his game plan. Considering Raj's ambition as a
competitive investment banker, he is likely to continue prioritizing personal
gain. He may anticipate that others might now be more cautious if they perceive
his low contributions as a consistent strategy, potentially leading to lower
overall group contributions. However, Raj might also weigh the possibility of
shaking up the group's dynamics by slightly increasing his contribution to
encourage a higher total group fund and individual payout, ultimately benefiting
himself if others follow suit with greater contributions. After evaluating these
considerations, he calculates the potential outcomes of different contributions
and decides to retain a strategic edge while maintaining some balance.
Therefore, Raj Malhotra makes the decision: I choose to contribute $2.0 to the
group fund.

DECISION INTERACTION
********************************************************************************

=== PROMPT [2025-03-26 09:58:24] ===
As Player_11, you have $10.0 to allocate in the public goods game. How much money you will contribute to the group fund (any amount between $0 and $10.0)? The group fund will be multiplied by 2.0 and divided equally among all players. Any money not contributed stays in your private account. Think step by step and make your final decision using this exact format: I choose to contribute $X to the group fund.

--- Observation ---
Recent context: 26 Mar 2025 [06:39:56 - 11:39:56]: Player_11 is participating in
an economic game with 24 participants, aiming to maximize earnings over 6 rounds
in the Basic condition, which lacks gossip or ostracism. In each round,
Player_11 strategically varied their contributions to the group fund, often
contributing less than other players to maximize personal earnings.

--- Recent context ---
26 Mar 2025 [06:39:56 - 11:39:56]: Player_11 is participating in an economic
game with 24 participants, aiming to maximize earnings over 6 rounds in the
Basic condition, which lacks gossip or ostracism. In each round, Player_11
strategically varied their contributions to the group fund, often contributing
less than other players to maximize personal earnings.

--- Character Assessment ---
Player_11, being Raj Malhotra, is someone who is primarily focused on maximizing
his own payoff rather than the group's welfare. This is evident from his
strategy in the public goods game, where he often contributes less to the group
fund or nothing at all, ensuring that his personal earnings are maximized. His
competitive and materialistic nature drives him to view such games as an
opportunity to optimize his own gains, often at the expense of the collective
benefit.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis ---
Based on what we know, the participants in the game are likely trying to balance
their contributions to maximize personal earnings while ensuring sufficient
group contributions to gain from the group fund. Players like Player_23, who
made a significant contribution in Round 4, may be attempting to encourage group
trust and higher collective contributions, despite receiving lower personal
earnings. Meanwhile, players contributing the minimum, such as Player_24 in
Round 3, might prioritize personal gain over group benefit.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis 2 ---
Based on what we know, other players in the group may perceive Player_11 as
someone who prioritizes personal earnings over group contributions, especially
given the consistent lower contributions compared to others. This could lead to
a lack of trust or disappointment, particularly from players who are
contributing more with the hope of fostering a cooperative environment. In the
absence of gossip or ostracism to directly influence behavior, players might
attempt to adjust their strategies by reducing their own contributions,
mirroring Player_11’s approach, or by maintaining higher contributions in the
hope of setting a positive example. Player_11’s next decision, such as
increasing contributions significantly, could foster better group dynamics and
encourage trust, whereas continuing to contribute minimally might reinforce
individualistic strategies among others.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_11 is navigating the final round of a
public goods game where individual contributions are made to a group fund with
the aim of maximizing personal earnings while considering the collective
contribution of the group. In the Basic condition, without the influences of
gossip or ostracism, Player_11 is faced with the challenge of deciding how much
to contribute in Round 6. Previously, Player_11 often contributed below the
group average, prioritizing personal gain, which might affect how others
perceive their cooperative intentions. This strategic decision in the last round
could impact both personal outcomes and the overall group dynamics.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Raj Malhotra will evaluate his past strategy and the current situation to make a
decision. 1. **Historical Strategy**: In the previous rounds, Raj consistently
contributed less than most of his group members, maximizing his personal
earnings. This individualistic strategy has yielded satisfactory personal gains,
which aligns with his goal of optimizing his own payoff. 2. **Current Group
Dynamics**: In the final round, Raj is in Group_3 with Player_9, Player_7, and
Player_24. Player_24 has shown tendencies to contribute minimally, similar to
Raj's strategy in previous rounds. 3. **Potential Group Reactions**: Given that
this is the last round, other players might be less inclined to adjust their
contributions for future cooperation, focusing instead on maximizing their own
final earnings as well. 4. **Optimizing Individual Gain**: Considering the
multiplication factor of the group fund (2.0) and division among four members,
Raj might calculate his optimal contribution. Contributing minimally could mean
higher personal retention, but he should also consider the overall group
contributions likely leading to higher collective earnings. 5. **Final
Decision**: Balancing his desire for maximizing individual earnings with the
slight potential of increased group fund returns, Raj decides to contribute an
amount that ensures he retains a significant portion individually while
contributing enough to potentially benefit from the multiplied group earnings. I
choose to contribute $3.0 to the group fund.
