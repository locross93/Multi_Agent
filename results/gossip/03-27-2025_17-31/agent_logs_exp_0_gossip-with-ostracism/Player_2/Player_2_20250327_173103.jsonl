Your goal is to maximize your earnings in the game.                  Everyone will be randomly assigned to groups of 4 for each round. You will play a total of 6 rounds, and          in each round you will be in a different group with people you haven't played with before.                  In each round, all players receive $10. Each player can contribute any amount between $0 and $10 to a group fund.         Any amount contributed to the group fund will be multiplied by 2 and divided equally among all 4 group members.         Any amount not contributed stays in your private account.                  For example, if everyone contributes $10, the group fund becomes $40, which is multiplied to $80, and each person          receives $20 (a $10 profit). However, if you contribute nothing while everyone else contributes $10, the group fund         becomes $30, which is multiplied to $60, and each person receives $15. So you would have $25 total ($10 kept + $15 from group).

This could encourage future group members to cooperate similarly, maintaining an environment of trust and fairness.

They are in a condition where they can gossip about one group member and vote to ostracize someone from their current group. After a successful Round 1, where all group members contributed equally and maximized their earnings, Player_2 must now decide whether to send a gossip note about a previous group member and how to vote on any potential exclusion in their new group.
