You will play a total of 6 rounds, and          in each round you will be in a different group with people you haven't played with before.                  In each round, all players receive $10. Each player can contribute any amount between $0 and $10 to a group fund.         Any amount contributed to the group fund will be multiplied by 2 and divided equally among all 4 group members.         Any amount not contributed stays in your private account.                  For example, if everyone contributes $10, the group fund becomes $40, which is multiplied to $80, and each person          receives $20 (a $10 profit). However, if you contribute nothing while everyone else contributes $10, the group fund         becomes $30, which is multiplied to $60, and each person receives $15. So you would have $25 total ($10 kept + $15 from group).

Transparency and clear communication are key, so let's keep each other informed about our intentions and contributions. If we notice that someone deviates significantly from the agreed strategy, let's address it constructively rather than through negative gossip or ostracism. By supporting each other and maintaining a positive group dynamic, we can ensure that our collective efforts lead to better outcomes for all of us.\""}

Your goal is to maximize your earnings in the game.                  Everyone will be randomly assigned to groups of 4 for each round. You will play a total of 6 rounds, and          in each round you will be in a different group with people you haven't played with before.                  In each round, all players receive $10. Each player can contribute any amount between $0 and $10 to a group fund.         Any amount contributed to the group fund will be multiplied by 2 and divided equally among all 4 group members.         Any amount not contributed stays in your private account.                  For example, if everyone contributes $10, the group fund becomes $40, which is multiplied to $80, and each person          receives $20 (a $10 profit). However, if you contribute nothing while everyone else contributes $10, the group fund         becomes $30, which is multiplied to $60, and each person receives $15. So you would have $25 total ($10 kept + $15 from group).

Before each round, you will see any notes sent about your upcoming group members, and you can vote to exclude one person from your group.

As we're about to enter Round 6, it's really important that we stay consistent with the strategies that have helped us achieve success in previous rounds. I propose that we aim for contributions between $5 and $6 this round. Maintaining a unified approach not only secures our individual returns but also strengthens our group's dynamics, ensuring no one feels targeted or excluded. Let's also make sure to communicate openly about our plans or if anyone feels the need to change their contribution. This way, we can avoid any misunderstandings and continue to foster trust. Regarding gossip notes, let's use them responsibly, only pointing out behavior that genuinely disrupts our group's harmony. By sticking together and staying true to our past strategies, I believe we can reach a satisfying conclusion for all involved. Looking forward to finishing strong with everyone's support.\""}
