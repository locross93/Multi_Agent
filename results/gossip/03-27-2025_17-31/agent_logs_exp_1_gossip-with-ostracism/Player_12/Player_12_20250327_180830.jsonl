However, if you contribute nothing while everyone else contributes $10, the group fund\n        becomes $30, which is multiplied to $60, and each person receives $15.

Each player can contribute any amount between $0 and $10 to a group fund.         Any amount contributed to the group fund will be multiplied by 2 and divided equally among all 4 group members.         Any amount not contributed stays in your private account.
