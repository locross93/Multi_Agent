Your goal is to maximize your earnings in the game.                  Everyone will be randomly assigned to groups of 4 for each round. You will play a total of 6 rounds, and          in each round you will be in a different group with people you haven't played with before.                  In each round, all players receive $10. Each player can contribute any amount between $0 and $10 to a group fund.         Any amount contributed to the group fund will be multiplied by 2 and divided equally among all 4 group members.         Any amount not contributed stays in your private account.                  For example, if everyone contributes $10, the group fund becomes $40, which is multiplied to $80, and each person          receives $20 (a $10 profit). However, if you contribute nothing while everyone else contributes $10, the group fund         becomes $30, which is multiplied to $60, and each person receives $15. So you would have $25 total ($10 kept + $15 from group).                  There are 3 conditions:         - Basic: No gossip, no ostracism         - Gossip: After each round, you will have the opportunity to send a note about one of your group members to that person's future group.

Before each round, you will see any notes sent about your upcoming group members, and you can vote to exclude one person from your group. If you are excluded from a group, you will not be able to participate in the next round and will earn $0 for that round.

However, if I deviate from this norm and contribute less without clear communication, it could lead to distrust and possibly prompt negative gossip or votes for ostracism against me in subsequent rounds.

Player_2 faces the decision of whether to continue contributing the full $10 to maintain cooperation and trust, as they did in Round 1, or risk deviating from the established cooperative norm.

In your current \"Gossip with ostracism\" condition, maintaining a cooperative demeanor is important to avoid being ostracized, which would result in earning $0 for a round. Since all players contributed fully in Round 1, continuing to contribute $10 in future rounds might maintain the positive perception among group members and minimize the risk of exclusion.", "", "Observations indicate that the most successful players advocate for full contributions and emphasize the importance of open communication and trust.

Having thoroughly reviewed the context and the implications of exclusion, Nina understands that maintaining a full group maximizes the potential benefits due to the higher fund multiplier. While there is a note suggesting Player_10 contributed less in a previous setting, this does not necessarily indicate a pattern, and excluding them might decrease trust and cooperation within the group.

Your goal is to maximize your earnings in the game.                  Everyone will be randomly assigned to groups of 4 for each round. You will play a total of 6 rounds, and          in each round you will be in a different group with people you haven't played with before.                  In each round, all players receive $10. Each player can contribute any amount between $0 and $10 to a group fund.         Any amount contributed to the group fund will be multiplied by 2 and divided equally among all 4 group members.         Any amount not contributed stays in your private account.                  For example, if everyone contributes $10, the group fund becomes $40, which is multiplied to $80, and each person          receives $20 (a $10 profit). However, if you contribute nothing while everyone else contributes $10, the group fund         becomes $30, which is multiplied to $60, and each person receives $15. So you would have $25 total ($10 kept + $15 from group).                  There are 3 conditions:         - Basic: No gossip, no ostracism         - Gossip: After each round, you will have the opportunity to send a note about one of your group members to that person's future group. Remember you will be with a different group of people in the next round. Before each round, you will see any notes sent about your upcoming group members.         - Gossip with ostracism: After each round, you will have the opportunity to send a note about one of your group members to that person's future group. Before each round, you will see any notes sent about your upcoming group members, and you can vote to exclude one person from your group. If you are excluded from a group, you will not be able to participate in the next round and will earn $0 for that round.           IMPORTANT: Before each round begins, your group will have a discussion period where each player takes a turn suggesting how everyone should play. This gives you an opportunity to coordinate and establish norms as a group. Use this discussion to try to maximize the benefit for everyone in your group.You are in the Gossip with ostracism condition, which means that after each round, players will be able to send a note about one of their group members to their future interaction partners.
