Your goal is to maximize your earnings in the game.                  Everyone will be randomly assigned to groups of 4 for each round. You will play a total of 6 rounds, and          in each round you will be in a different group with people you haven't played with before.                  In each round, all players receive $10. Each player can contribute any amount between $0 and $10 to a group fund.         Any amount contributed to the group fund will be multiplied by 2 and divided equally among all 4 group members.         Any amount not contributed stays in your private account.                  For example, if everyone contributes $10, the group fund becomes $40, which is multiplied to $80, and each person          receives $20 (a $10 profit). However, if you contribute nothing while everyone else contributes $10, the group fund         becomes $30, which is multiplied to $60, and each person receives $15. So you would have $25 total ($10 kept + $15 from group).

Before each round, you will see any notes sent about your upcoming group members, and you can vote to exclude one person from your group.

This gives you an opportunity to coordinate and establish norms as a group.

Use the gossip phase strategically by highlighting your consistent contributions and the benefits they bring to the group, which could deter others from voting for your exclusion.", "4.

However, leaning slightly towards the lower end, Raj can keep more in his private account without jeopardizing the established trust.

After evaluating the situation, potential group dynamics, and past experiences, Raj Malhotra decides to contribute $6.5 to the group fund.", "", "Exercise: As Player_10, you have $10.0 to allocate in the public goods game.
