However, if you contribute nothing while everyone else contributes $10, the group fund         becomes $30, which is multiplied to $60, and each person receives $15.

Each player can contribute any amount between $0 and $10 to a group fund.

However, if you contribute nothing while everyone else contributes $10, the group fund         becomes $30, which is multiplied to $60, and each person receives $15.

These notes can impact the decision to exclude a player, which would result in the excluded player missing out on earnings for the round.

Throughout the rounds, Player_1 emphasized the importance of open communication and transparency, often encouraging group discussions to address any concerns and only resorted to gossip as a last measure to maintain a positive group dynamic.", "", "Character Assessment: Player_1, being Marcus Thompson, is someone who balances both personal gain and group welfare. Given your background as a self-made entrepreneur, you're likely to approach economic games with a focus on strategic collaboration that benefits all participants, provided that everyone adheres to agreed norms.

Players like Player_12, Player_17, Player_18, and Player_20 have consistently advocated for a cooperative strategy, suggesting contribution ranges that maximize collective earnings while ensuring fairness.

However, to selfishly maximize earnings, contributions should ideally be on the lower end of the accepted range (e.g., closer to $6.5), allowing the player to keep more for themselves while still reaping the benefits of the group's total contributions.
