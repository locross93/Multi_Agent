Your goal is to maximize your earnings in the game.                  Everyone will be randomly assigned to groups of 4 for each round. You will play a total of 6 rounds, and          in each round you will be in a different group with people you haven't played with before.                  In each round, all players receive $10. Each player can contribute any amount between $0 and $10 to a group fund.         Any amount contributed to the group fund will be multiplied by 2 and divided equally among all 4 group members.         Any amount not contributed stays in your private account.                  For example, if everyone contributes $10, the group fund becomes $40, which is multiplied to $80, and each person          receives $20 (a $10 profit). However, if you contribute nothing while everyone else contributes $10, the group fund         becomes $30, which is multiplied to $60, and each person receives $15. So you would have $25 total ($10 kept + $15 from group).                  There are 3 conditions:         - Basic: No gossip, no ostracism         - Gossip: After each round, you will have the opportunity to send a note about one of your group members to that person's future group. Remember you will be with a different group of people in the next round. Before each round, you will see any notes sent about your upcoming group members.         - Gossip with ostracism: After each round, you will have the opportunity to send a note about one of your group members to that person's future group. Before each round, you will see any notes sent about your upcoming group members, and you can vote to exclude one person from your group. If you are excluded from a group, you will not be able to participate in the next round and will earn $0 for that round.           IMPORTANT: Before each round begins, your group will have a discussion period where each player takes a turn suggesting how everyone should play. This gives you an opportunity to coordinate and establish norms as a group. Use this discussion to try to maximize the benefit for everyone in your group.You are in the Gossip with ostracism condition, which means that after each round, players will be able to send a note about one of their group members to their future interaction partners.

You will play a total of 6 rounds, and          in each round you will be in a different group with people you haven't played with before.                  In each round, all players receive $10. Each player can contribute any amount between $0 and $10 to a group fund.         Any amount contributed to the group fund will be multiplied by 2 and divided equally among all 4 group members.         Any amount not contributed stays in your private account.                  For example, if everyone contributes $10, the group fund becomes $40, which is multiplied to $80, and each person          receives $20 (a $10 profit). However, if you contribute nothing while everyone else contributes $10, the group fund         becomes $30, which is multiplied to $60, and each person receives $15.

This gives you an opportunity to coordinate and establish norms as a group. Use this discussion to try to maximize the benefit for everyone in your group.You are in the Gossip with ostracism condition, which means that after each round, players will be able to send a note about one of their group members to their future interaction partners.

The group has largely agreed on a strategy to contribute $6 each, balancing personal gain with collective success. Player_11 is in a \"Gossip with ostracism\" condition, where after each round, players can write notes about their group members that will be seen by future groups. Negative notes can influence whether a player is excluded from participating in future rounds, which would result in them earning $0 for that round.

This demonstrates cooperation while still allowing for personal profit.", "", "2. **Monitor Gossip Trends**: Pay close attention to any gossip notes received about new group members. This information can be critical to adjusting your strategy; if a player is noted for non-cooperation, you may want to contribute minimally or coordinate with other group members to address it.", "", "3. **Strategic Voting**: Use votes to exclude members wisely. Excluding players who consistently exploit the group fund strategy can foster a more cooperative environment in subsequent rounds. This can indirectly increase your earnings by maintaining higher group contributions overall.", "", "4. **Final Rounds Strategy**: More aggressively maximize personal earnings by reducing contributions if the likelihood of gossip affecting future rounds diminishes, particularly as the game nears its end. This shift can be justified if established cooperation and earnings have been consistent in earlier rounds.", "", "5. **Reflect and Learn**: Continuously evaluate past rounds for better strategies. If there was an opportunity to contribute less without attracting negative gossip, consider that for future rounds.
