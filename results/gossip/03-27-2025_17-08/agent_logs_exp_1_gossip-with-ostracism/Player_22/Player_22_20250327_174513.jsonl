However, if you contribute nothing while everyone else contributes $10, the group fund\n        becomes $30, which is multiplied to $60, and each person receives $15.

Your goal is to maximize your earnings in the game.                  Everyone will be randomly assigned to groups of 4 for each round. You will play a total of 6 rounds, and          in each round you will be in a different group with people you haven't played with before.                  In each round, all players receive $10. Each player can contribute any amount between $0 and $10 to a group fund.         Any amount contributed to the group fund will be multiplied by 2 and divided equally among all 4 group members.         Any amount not contributed stays in your private account.                  For example, if everyone contributes $10, the group fund becomes $40, which is multiplied to $80, and each person          receives $20 (a $10 profit). However, if you contribute nothing while everyone else contributes $10, the group fund         becomes $30, which is multiplied to $60, and each person receives $15. So you would have $25 total ($10 kept + $15 from group).                  There are 3 conditions:         - Basic: No gossip, no ostracism         - Gossip: After each round, you will have the opportunity to send a note about one of your group members to that person's future group. Remember you will be with a different group of people in the next round. Before each round, you will see any notes sent about your upcoming group members.         - Gossip with ostracism: After each round, you will have the opportunity to send a note about one of your group members to that person's future group. Before each round, you will see any notes sent about your upcoming group members, and you can vote to exclude one person from your group. If you are excluded from a group, you will not be able to participate in the next round and will earn $0 for that round.           IMPORTANT: Before each round begins, your group will have a discussion period where each player takes a turn suggesting how everyone should play. This gives you an opportunity to coordinate and establish norms as a group. Use this discussion to try to maximize the benefit for everyone in your group.You are in the Gossip with ostracism condition, which means that after each round, players will be able to send a note about one of their group members to their future interaction partners.

This note will be seen by their future groups, potentially influencing their trust and cooperation. At the same time, Maria must also evaluate gossip received about current group members, which will inform the decision on whether to vote for excluding someone from the current group to avoid being ostracized themselves. The decision-making process involves balancing the need to maintain a cooperative image, the strategic use of gossip, and protecting oneself from possible exclusion in future rounds.", "", "Strategy Reflection: Based on what we know, maintaining an initial strategy of moderate cooperation while being observant of others' behavior is crucial in maximizing earnings.

Continuing with the $6 contribution would probably reinforce this perception and maintain a stable collaborative dynamic, minimizing any risks of exclusion or negative gossip. However, if Player_22 decides to increase the contribution to $7, it might be viewed positively as an indication of further commitment to the group's success, potentially encouraging others to follow suit. This shift could enhance trust further, but it would be essential to ensure that all players are comfortable with the decision to maintain harmony.

For this last round, sticking to the $6 contribution appears prudent, given there is no subsequent round to potentially adjust if the strategy fails.", "", "4. Gossip and Group Exclusion Dynamics: Ensuring a positive note is sent or received can prevent exclusion in rounds where it\u2019s possible, as exclusion would result in losing all potential earnings for that round.
