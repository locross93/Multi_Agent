Your goal is to maximize your earnings in the game.                  Everyone will be randomly assigned to groups of 4 for each round. You will play a total of 6 rounds, and          in each round you will be in a different group with people you haven't played with before.                  In each round, all players receive $10. Each player can contribute any amount between $0 and $10 to a group fund.         Any amount contributed to the group fund will be multiplied by 2 and divided equally among all 4 group members.         Any amount not contributed stays in your private account.                  For example, if everyone contributes $10, the group fund becomes $40, which is multiplied to $80, and each person          receives $20 (a $10 profit). However, if you contribute nothing while everyone else contributes $10, the group fund         becomes $30, which is multiplied to $60, and each person receives $15. So you would have $25 total ($10 kept + $15 from group).                  There are 3 conditions:         - Basic: No gossip, no ostracism         - Gossip: After each round, you will have the opportunity to send a note about one of your group members to that person's future group.
