You will play a total of 6 rounds, and          in each round you will be in a different group with people you haven't played with before.                  In each round, all players receive $10. Each player can contribute any amount between $0 and $10 to a group fund.         Any amount contributed to the group fund will be multiplied by 2 and divided equally among all 4 group members.         Any amount not contributed stays in your private account.

However, if you contribute nothing while everyone else contributes $10, the group fund         becomes $30, which is multiplied to $60, and each person receives $15.

For example, if everyone contributes $10, the group fund becomes $40, which is multiplied to $80, and each person          receives $20 (a $10 profit). However, if you contribute nothing while everyone else contributes $10, the group fund         becomes $30, which is multiplied to $60, and each person receives $15. So you would have $25 total ($10 kept + $15 from group).

Before each round, you will see any notes sent about your upcoming group members.         - Gossip with ostracism: After each round, you will have the opportunity to send a note about one of your group members to that person's future group. Before each round, you will see any notes sent about your upcoming group members, and you can vote to exclude one person from your group. If you are excluded from a group, you will not be able to participate in the next round and will earn $0 for that round.

This gives you an opportunity to coordinate and establish norms as a group.

This higher contribution likely established a foundation of trust and signaled cooperation to your group members. Early on, such cooperative behavior helps build a positive reputation, making you less likely to be excluded in future rounds.", "", "2. **Maintain Cooperative Norms (Rounds 2-3):** Subsequently contributing $6 along with advocating for this amount keeps you aligned with the group strategy. It is important to follow this to avoid standing out in a negative way, especially since mutual cooperation has been the prevailing strategy among successful players. Maintaining a level playing field ensures that you are seen as trustworthy and prevents the risk of being ostracized.", "", "3. **Utilize Gossip to Bolster Reputation:** Sending positive gossip notes about consistent contributors not only fosters a supportive environment but also increases the likelihood of reciprocal positive notes that could protect you from exclusion. Given that gossip impacts group dynamics, managing it wisely is crucial to secure cooperative partners and avoid being singled out.", "", "4. **Evaluate and Adapt (Mid to Late Rounds):** While maintaining cooperation, remain vigilant about group dynamics. If contributions start varying or if someone begins to deviate or strategize more selfishly, consider adapting your approach to either isolate uncooperative players through gossip or aligning with other consistent contributors.", "", "5. **Reassess Risk in Final Rounds:** As you approach the final rounds, you may consider slightly adjusting contributions to maximize immediate earnings if you are confident in your standing and believe there is minimal risk of being ostracized. However, capricious behavior should be avoided if it risks upsetting the balance or your reputation.", "", "6. **Reflect and Learn:** Although earlier decisions largely align with best practices, continual reassessment based on late-stage observations will enhance adaptive decision-making. Be ready to alter contributions in response to changes in group dynamics or if exclusion becomes a notable threat.", "", "In summary, continuous cooperation, strategic gossip use, and adaptability in contributions based on other players' behaviors will help optimize your earnings throughout the game.
