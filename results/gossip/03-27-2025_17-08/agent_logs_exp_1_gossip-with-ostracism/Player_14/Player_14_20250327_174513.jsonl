You will play a total of 6 rounds, and          in each round you will be in a different group with people you haven't played with before.                  In each round, all players receive $10. Each player can contribute any amount between $0 and $10 to a group fund.         Any amount contributed to the group fund will be multiplied by 2 and divided equally among all 4 group members.         Any amount not contributed stays in your private account.                  For example, if everyone contributes $10, the group fund becomes $40, which is multiplied to $80, and each person          receives $20 (a $10 profit). However, if you contribute nothing while everyone else contributes $10, the group fund         becomes $30, which is multiplied to $60, and each person receives $15. So you would have $25 total ($10 kept + $15 from group).                  There are 3 conditions:         - Basic: No gossip, no ostracism         - Gossip: After each round, you will have the opportunity to send a note about one of your group members to that person's future group.

Before each round, you will see any notes sent about your upcoming group members, and you can vote to exclude one person from your group. If you are excluded from a group, you will not be able to participate in the next round and will earn $0 for that round.           IMPORTANT: Before each round begins, your group will have a discussion period where each player takes a turn suggesting how everyone should play. This gives you an opportunity to coordinate and establish norms as a group.

By consistently suggesting contributions of $7 and promoting positive communication, Player_14 has positioned themselves as a team-oriented player. This has likely built a foundation of trust and collaboration.", "", "Situation Analysis: The current situation is that Player_14 is in the final round of the public goods game, Round 6/6, where they are in a group with Player_21, Player_23, and Player_19. Player_14 finds themselves in a setting known as the \"Gossip with ostracism\" condition. This means that players receive feedback through anonymous notes from previous rounds and have the opportunity to vote to exclude one of their group members. Due to this setup, there is a risk of being ostracized, which would prevent participation in the current round and result in earning $0. However, Player_14 has built a reputation for advocating a strategy that emphasizes cooperation and a contribution of $7, fostering high group earnings, trust, and positive dynamics, which might influence their group members to perceive them favorably.", "", "Strategy Reflection: Based on what we know, the best strategy for maximizing long-term earnings in the public goods game is to balance individual interests with group dynamics, especially given the current conditions of participating in a \"Gossip with ostracism\" setup.", "", "1. **Observations:** The game involves a delicate balance of contributing enough to maintain trust and avoid ostracism while maximizing individual earnings. The successful strategy observed among other players, like consistent contributions of $7, seems to bolster group trust and maximize both group and personal earnings by aligning individual actions with group goals.", "", "2. **Cooperation and Earnings:** Given the condition of potential ostracism, it's crucial to maintain a semblance of cooperation to avoid being excluded from future rounds, which would result in earning $0. Therefore, a consistent contribution close to the group average ($7) appears beneficial as it supports cooperation and mitigates the risk of negative gossip leading to exclusion.", "", "3. **Past Decision Analysis:** Analyzing past decisions, consistently advocating for a $7 contribution was smart since it aligns with what the group perceives as cooperative and fair, maintaining group harmony. Past cooperation has ensured steady earnings and avoided exclusion. However, being overly cooperative without strategic consideration in the final rounds might reduce potential individual gains.", "", "4. **Future Strategy Adjustments:** In progressing rounds, especially the final one, it's rational to maintain the established contribution pattern to ensure stability unless there's a strong inclination or consensus within the group to alter the strategy for potentially higher individual gains. Given the past success and the importance of not being ostracized, contributing $7 remains a robust strategy.", "", "In conclusion, staying aligned with the group strategy, providing consistent contributions, and balancing cooperation with strategic foresight is vital for maximizing personal earnings, especially in a gossip-based ostracism condition where group perceptions significantly impact outcomes.", "", "Decision Reflection: Raj Malhotra will choose not to exclude anyone from his group. Given the positive notes about both Player_19 and Player_21, emphasizing their consistent and fair contributions, it would be strategically wise to maintain the group as it is.
