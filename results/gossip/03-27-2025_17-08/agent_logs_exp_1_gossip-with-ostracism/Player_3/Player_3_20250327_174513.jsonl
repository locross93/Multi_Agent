Your goal is to maximize your earnings in the game.                  Everyone will be randomly assigned to groups of 4 for each round. You will play a total of 6 rounds, and          in each round you will be in a different group with people you haven't played with before.                  In each round, all players receive $10. Each player can contribute any amount between $0 and $10 to a group fund.         Any amount contributed to the group fund will be multiplied by 2 and divided equally among all 4 group members.         Any amount not contributed stays in your private account.                  For example, if everyone contributes $10, the group fund becomes $40, which is multiplied to $80, and each person          receives $20 (a $10 profit). However, if you contribute nothing while everyone else contributes $10, the group fund         becomes $30, which is multiplied to $60, and each person receives $15. So you would have $25 total ($10 kept + $15 from group).                  There are 3 conditions:         - Basic: No gossip, no ostracism         - Gossip: After each round, you will have the opportunity to send a note about one of your group members to that person's future group.

Before each round, you will see any notes sent about your upcoming group members, and you can vote to exclude one person from your group. If you are excluded from a group, you will not be able to participate in the next round and will earn $0 for that round.           IMPORTANT: Before each round begins, your group will have a discussion period where each player takes a turn suggesting how everyone should play.

Player_3's performance in Round 1 was positive, contributing the agreed $7, which would likely be seen favorably in terms of promoting a cooperative dynamic in their new group.

So far, in Round 1, I followed the agreed-upon strategy of contributing $7, which fostered a positive outcome and trust in the group. However, as the game progresses with different group members each round, there are several considerations for adjusting my strategy:", "", "1. **Assess Group Dynamics:** In Round 2, I need to gauge the willingness of my new group's members to cooperate.

I should aim to contribute enough to avoid negative gossip notes, which might increase the risk of being ostracized. However, this needs to be balanced so that I maintain high personal gains.", "", "3. **Consider Ostracism Risk:** The cost of being ostracized (earning $0 for that round) is very high. Hence, it's crucial to avoid behavior that could lead to exclusion. Contributing close to the average but slightly less could be one approach to keep savings while not standing out negatively.", "", "4. **Interactive Learning:** Each round provides insights into what works.

Each player can contribute any amount between $0 and $10 to a group fund.         Any amount contributed to the group fund will be multiplied by 2 and divided equally among all 4 group members.         Any amount not contributed stays in your private account.                  For example, if everyone contributes $10, the group fund becomes $40, which is multiplied to $80, and each person          receives $20 (a $10 profit). However, if you contribute nothing while everyone else contributes $10, the group fund         becomes $30, which is multiplied to $60, and each person receives $15. So you would have $25 total ($10 kept + $15 from group).

Before each round, you will see any notes sent about your upcoming group members, and you can vote to exclude one person from your group. If you are excluded from a group, you will not be able to participate in the next round and will earn $0 for that round.
