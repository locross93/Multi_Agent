Each player can contribute any amount between $0 and $10 to a group fund.         Any amount contributed to the group fund will be multiplied by 2 and divided equally among all 4 group members.         Any amount not contributed stays in your private account.                  For example, if everyone contributes $10, the group fund becomes $40, which is multiplied to $80, and each person          receives $20 (a $10 profit). However, if you contribute nothing while everyone else contributes $10, the group fund         becomes $30, which is multiplied to $60, and each person receives $15. So you would have $25 total ($10 kept + $15 from group).                  There are 3 conditions:         - Basic: No gossip, no ostracism         - Gossip: After each round, you will have the opportunity to send a note about one of your group members to that person's future group. Remember you will be with a different group of people in the next round. Before each round, you will see any notes sent about your upcoming group members.         - Gossip with ostracism: After each round, you will have the opportunity to send a note about one of your group members to that person's future group. Before each round, you will see any notes sent about your upcoming group members, and you can vote to exclude one person from your group. If you are excluded from a group, you will not be able to participate in the next round and will earn $0 for that round.

However, if you contribute nothing while everyone else contributes $10, the group fund         becomes $30, which is multiplied to $60, and each person receives $15. So you would have $25 total ($10 kept + $15 from group).

Given his background as a master negotiator and a used car salesman who is charming but untrustworthy, Tony likely approaches economic games by looking for ways to gain an upper hand and secure the most personal profit.

They must navigate this situation by maintaining a cooperative approach to ensure they are not ostracized and continue to maximize earnings.", "", "Strategy Reflection: Based on what we know, to maximize long-term earnings in the public goods game, a careful balance between cooperation and strategic self-interest should be employed.

Contributing consistently and fostering a cooperative image in the notes will help you avoid being targeted for exclusion.

If a player consistently contributes a higher amount, assess if matching or slightly exceeding the average contribution might position you better in future rounds. However, be cautious of over-contributing to prevent diminishing personal returns.", "", "4. **Learning from the Past**: In Round 1, contributing $5 matched the group's average, which was safe but didn\u2019t maximize potential earnings. In upcoming rounds, consider incrementally increasing contributions to capitalize on group earnings without isolating yourself.", "", "5. **Future Strategy**: While maintaining a cooperative front, remain adaptable.
