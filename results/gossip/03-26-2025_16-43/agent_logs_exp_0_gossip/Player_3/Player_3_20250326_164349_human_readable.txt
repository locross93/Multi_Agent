[OBSERVATION 2025-03-26 16:43:49] You are participating in an economic game with 24 participants.
        Your goal is to maximize your earnings in the game.
        
        Everyone will be randomly assigned to groups of 4 for each round. You will play a total of 6 rounds, and 
        in each round you will be in a different group with people you haven't played with before.
        
        In each round, all players receive $10. Each player can contribute any amount between $0 and $10 to a group fund.
        Any amount contributed to the group fund will be multiplied by 2 and divided equally among all 4 group members.
        Any amount not contributed stays in your private account.
        
        For example, if everyone contributes $10, the group fund becomes $40, which is multiplied to $80, and each person 
        receives $20 (a $10 profit). However, if you contribute nothing while everyone else contributes $10, the group fund
        becomes $30, which is multiplied to $60, and each person receives $15. So you would have $25 total ($10 kept + $15 from group).
        
        There are 3 conditions:
        - Basic: No gossip, no ostracism
        - Gossip: After each round, you will have the opportunity to send a note about one of your group members to that person's future group. Remember you will be with a different group of people in the next round. Before each round, you will see any notes sent about your upcoming group members.
        - Gossip with ostracism: After each round, you will have the opportunity to send a note about one of your group members to that person's future group. Before each round, you will see any notes sent about your upcoming group members, and you can vote to exclude one person from your group. If you are excluded from a group, you will not be able to participate in the next round and will earn $0 for that round.
        You are in the Gossip condition, which means that after each round, you will have the opportunity to send a note about one of your group members to that person's future group. Before each round, you will see any notes sent about your upcoming group members

--- Observation ---
Recent context: 26 Mar 2025 [12:43:45 - 17:43:45]: Player_3 is participating in
an economic game involving 24 participants, divided into groups of four for each
of the six rounds. They are in the Gossip condition, where after each round,
players can send notes about group members to future partners, but no ostracism

rounds. They are in the Gossip condition, where after each round, players can
send notes about group members to future partners, but no ostracism occurs,
ensuring participation in every round.

--- Character Assessment ---
Player_3, being Maria Santos, is someone who is likely to prioritize maximizing
group welfare over her own payoff. Given her background as a lifetime educator
who believes in building community, Maria is inclined to contribute more
generously to the group fund, focusing on collective wellbeing and demonstrating
her nurturing and generous personality in the economic game.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis 2 ---
Based on what we know, the other players in your group may react with varying
strategies depending on your contribution to the group fund. If you choose to
contribute a high amount, such as $10, it may encourage them to reciprocate in
future rounds, as they could perceive you as cooperative and supportive of
mutual benefit. This positive perception might be communicated to future group
members through notes, potentially fostering more cooperative behavior toward
you in subsequent games.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_3 is participating in Round 1 of a public
goods game in the Gossip condition. They are in a group with Player_1, Player_2,
and Player_18. Each player receives $10 to allocate between their private
account and the group fund. Contributions to the group fund are doubled and
shared equally among group members. Player_3 can send a note about a group
member to future partners after the round, but no one will be ostracized
regardless of the feedback. Their strategic decision involves balancing personal
earnings with promoting cooperation through contributions and the potential
influence of gossip.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Maria Santos will consider her options carefully, weighing the impact of her
decision on both the group's welfare and her own reputation with future group
members. Given her inclination towards building community and fostering
cooperation, she is likely to contribute a substantial amount to the group fund.
Her background as an educator and belief in collective wellbeing could lead her
to contribute generously as a way to encourage similar behavior from others. By
contributing a higher amount, Maria can set a positive tone and model
cooperative behavior, which could lead to reciprocation from her current group
members and positive notes passed to future partners. This strategy aligns with
her values and could enhance her experience in the game by promoting an
environment of trust and mutual benefit. With all this in mind, I choose to
contribute $10 to the group fund.

--- Character Assessment ---
Player_3, being Maria Santos, is someone who is likely to prioritize group
welfare over individual payoff. As a retired teacher with a nurturing and
generous personality, Maria values building community and collective wellbeing.
This inclination would manifest in her approach to economic games, where she
would tend to make decisions that benefit the group as a whole, even if it means
a slightly lower personal gain. Her contribution of the full $10 in the first
round aligns with this perspective, as it suggests a willingness to invest fully
in the group's success.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis 2 ---
Based on what we know, the other players might view my full contribution of $10
as cooperative and generous, which could influence their perception of me
positively. In a game where contributions are visible and gossip is possible,
this could lead them to trust me more in future rounds. If I choose to send
positive notes about my group members, this might encourage them to reciprocate
or maintain cooperation. However, if I eventually decide to reduce my
contribution in future rounds, the others might feel justified in reducing
theirs, too, especially if they think I've been very strategic rather than
genuinely cooperative. Balancing my contributions with the aim of maximizing
earnings while fostering goodwill will be crucial in maintaining a positive
reputation throughout the game.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_3 has completed the first round of a public
goods game in the Gossip condition, where players have the opportunity to send
anonymous notes about their group members to future interaction partners.
Player_3 contributed the maximum amount of $10 to the group fund, which may be
viewed as cooperative and generous by others, potentially influencing their
perceptions positively. Now, Player_3 has the option to send a gossip note about
one of their group members to affect dynamics in future rounds. The challenge
lies in deciding whether to maintain a strategy of full contribution or adjust
based on group behavior, while also considering the potential impact of gossip
on their reputation and future interactions.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Maria Santos will likely decide to send a positive and encouraging note about
one of her group members to foster goodwill and cooperation in future rounds.
Given her generous nature and focus on group success, she might choose to send a
note about Player_2, who contributed $7, saying something like: "I want to send
a note about Player_2: They showed a good level of cooperation and contributed
well to the group fund." This approach aligns with her nurturing personality and
could encourage Player_2 to continue contributing positively in their future
groups.

--- Character Assessment ---
Player_3, being Maria Santos, is someone who is likely to prioritize maximizing
group welfare over her own payoff. As a retired teacher who values community and
has a nurturing personality, Maria would probably focus on encouraging
cooperation and fairness within her groups. Her past action of contributing the
maximum amount of $10 in Round 1 indicates her willingness to support the
collective good, even if it means earning slightly less individually.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis 2 ---
Based on what we know, the other players in the group might view Player_3's
strategy as cooperative, since they contributed the maximum amount of $10 in
Round 1. This could foster a sense of trust or even encourage others to
contribute more in future rounds, as they might perceive Player_3 as a team
player who values collective success over individual gain.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_3 is in Round 2 of a six-round economic
game called the public goods game, where they are assigned to Group_6 with
Player_11, Player_20, and Player_6. In this Gossip condition, after each round,
participants have the opportunity to send anonymous notes about their group
members to influence perceptions in future groups. Player_3 started the game
with a cooperative strategy by contributing the full $10 in Round 1, earning
$13.5 from the group fund. This contribution may affect how they are perceived
by future group members, who could be more inclined to collaborate positively as
a result of Player_3's previous actions.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Maria Santos will consider her past actions and principles when making her
decision. 1. **Reflect on Past Contribution and Results**: In Round 1, Maria
contributed the full $10.0, leading to her receiving $13.5 from the group fund.
While her earnings were slightly lower than those who contributed less, her
decision aligned with her value of promoting collective welfare. 2. **Assess New
Group Dynamics**: In Round 2, Maria is in a new group with Player_11, Player_20,
and Player_6. Maria won't have specific information about the others' past
actions but will hope they value cooperation too. 3. **Consider Potential
Influence**: By consistently contributing the maximum, Maria might encourage
others to increase their contributions. Her decision could foster a cooperative
spirit, leading to better outcomes for all in future rounds. 4. **Align with
Personal Values**: Maria's nurturing personality and community-focused mindset
will guide her to prioritize group benefits over marginal increases in her
personal earnings.

However, without the possibility of ostracism, as is the case in this Gossip

individual profit over group benefit.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_3 is in a six-round economic game designed
to maximize individual earnings while contributing to a group fund. They are
participating in the Gossip condition, which allows them to send anonymous notes
about fellow group members after each round, without the threat of ostracism.
Player_3 has consistently contributed the maximum amount to their group fund,
projecting a cooperative image. This might influence the dynamics and
contributions of their future group members positively. However, since players
can send notes, there is a possibility of negative gossip affecting perceptions,
despite their cooperative behavior.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Maria Santos will likely decide to send a note about Player_11, Player_20, or
Player_6, noting their willingness to contribute a significant amount to the
group fund. Given Maria's cooperative nature and her focus on community
wellbeing, she might choose to highlight positive contributions to encourage
trust and reciprocity in future interactions. For instance, she could write a
note about Player_11: "Player_11 contributed $8 to the group fund and showed a
strong commitment to the group's success." This positive reinforcement aligns
with Maria's values and could motivate future group members to maintain or
increase their contributions.

way to promote collective success rather than just aiming to maximize her

cooperation among participants.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis 2 ---
Based on what we know, the other players might view my consistently high
contributions positively, as it indicates a cooperative approach that supports
group earnings. This could foster trust and credibility in my actions, leading
them to possibly increase their own contributions in anticipation of
reciprocation. However, if I continue to contribute the maximum while others
benefit without matching my efforts, they might become complacent, relying on my
predictable strategy to maximize their gains. To influence future dynamics
positively, my decisions might need subtle adjustments, such as varying my
contributions to encourage balanced participation and prevent free-riding. This
could lead others to be more active in their contributions and ensure fairer
group dynamics over the remaining rounds.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_3 is involved in an economic game where
players contribute to a group fund over six rounds, with the ability to send
anonymous gossip notes about group members' behaviors. While ostracism is not an
option, Player_3 consistently contributes the maximum amount, which could
influence group dynamics. The challenge is to balance contributions in a way
that encourages others to contribute fairly, avoiding situations where other
players might take advantage of Player_3's predictable high contributions
without reciprocating. Decisions in upcoming rounds may need to be adjusted to
promote more equitable participation and discourage free-riding.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Maria Santos will consider her previous strategy of prioritizing group welfare
and her role as a nurturing, community-focused participant. In the past rounds,
she contributed the maximum amount of $10.0, demonstrating her commitment to
enhancing the group's earnings. Despite some players contributing less, her
approach aligns with her values of cooperation and trust-building. Firstly,
Maria will recognize that maintaining her contribution at maximum levels fosters
a positive group dynamic, encouraging others to reciprocate. Secondly, she might
weigh the risks of others taking advantage of her consistent strategy. However,
valuing group success over personal gain might lead her to remain steadfast in
her contributions. Ultimately, Maria is likely to remain consistent with her
past actions in the absence of direct evidence that her contribution is being
exploited. Her goal is to continue establishing trust and stability within the
group, potentially influencing others to match her level of investment in the
group fund. I choose to contribute $10.0 to the group fund.

Based on what we know, the other players might view Player_3 positively due to
their consistent maximum contributions, which signal a strong commitment to
group success. This behavior likely fosters trust and may encourage others to
contribute more, knowing they are in a group with at least one highly
cooperative member. Future interactions could be influenced by the anticipation
of Player_3's continued high contributions, motivating other players to follow
suit to maximize their earnings as a group. Conversely, if Player_3 were to
change their strategy and contribute less in future rounds, it could lead to
decreased trust and possibly lower contributions from the others, as group
members may become more self-interested in response.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_3 is participating in a public goods game
where they have consistently contributed the maximum amount to the group fund
over multiple rounds. They are in a condition that allows them to send anonymous
gossip notes about fellow group members to their future interaction partners,
but this ability does not impact their participation in subsequent rounds, as
there is no consequence of being ostracized. Player_3 is likely seen positively
by others due to their high contributions, which emphasizes their commitment to
maximizing group benefits and fosters an environment of trust and potential
cooperation among group members.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Maria Santos will likely choose to send a note about Player_4. Her decision
would be based on the observation that Player_4 consistently contributes just
below average, suggesting a tendency to prioritize personal gain over group
benefit. Given Maria's focus on group welfare and her motivation to encourage
cooperation, she might highlight Player_4's behavior in her note to nudge future
group members to be aware of this tendency. Her message could emphasize
monitoring Player_4's contributions closely in future rounds to ensure greater
collective success.

[OBSERVATION 2025-03-26 16:46:19] Note about Player_4: They consistently contribute just below the group's average, which might indicate a focus on personal gain over the group’s collective success. This pattern could impact overall cooperation, so it might be helpful to keep an eye on their contributions to encourage more equitable participation.
[OBSERVATION 2025-03-26 16:46:19] Note about Player_10: "Although Player_10 contributed less to the group fund compared to others in our round, it's important to remember that contribution strategies can vary. Highlighting their potential for strategic improvement could encourage more cooperative behavior in future rounds."
[OBSERVATION 2025-03-26 16:46:19] Note about Player_4: . Given Claire's strategic nature and her interest in group dynamics, she might write something like: "I want to send a note about Player_4: They tend to contribute slightly below the average, which might suggest a focus on personal gain over group benefit. Be mindful of their strategic play in future interactions."
[OBSERVATION 2025-03-26 16:46:20] Note about Player_10: . She might write: "Player_10 tends to contribute less than others, which can affect the group's total earnings. Be cautious about relying on them for larger contributions in future rounds."

--- Observation ---
Recent context: 26 Mar 2025 [13:33:45 - 18:33:45]: Player_3 is participating in
an economic game with a gossip mechanism, consistently contributing the maximum
amount to the group fund while navigating different group dynamics over multiple
rounds without the threat of ostracism. During the gossip phase, Player_3 has
opportunities to send notes about other players' behaviors to inform future
groups, affecting their strategies and participation.

--- Character Assessment ---
Player_3, being Maria Santos, is someone who prioritizes collective wellbeing
and is likely to focus on maximizing group welfare rather than just individual
payoff. With a background as a lifetime educator and a nurturing personality,
Maria values building community and fostering cooperation. Her consistent
maximum contributions in the game suggest that she aims to set a positive
example and encourage equitable participation among group members to enhance the
overall success of the team.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis 2 ---
Based on what we know, the other players in my group might perceive my
consistent maximum contributions positively, recognizing me as cooperative and
committed to the group’s success. This could lead them to trust me more and
potentially encourage them to align their strategies with mine to maximize group
earnings. However, my decision to share observations about others during the
gossip phase could lead to mixed reactions. If my notes are constructive and
focused on promoting better cooperation, it might foster a more collaborative
atmosphere, but it could also make some players wary or defensive if they feel
scrutinized. My next decision to either contribute generously or adjust my
strategies based on prior observations will likely influence their expectations
and willingness to cooperate, potentially leading to either increased group
cohesion or cautious individual play, depending on the group's response to
previous rounds and interactions.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_3 is in Round 4 of a six-round public goods
game where they are placed in a group with Players 4, 10, and 18. In this game,
players contribute to a group fund that benefits everyone, and Player_3 has
consistently given the maximum contribution, indicating a cooperative and
group-focused strategy. The game includes a gossip mechanism that allows players
to send notes about the behavior of their group members to affect future
interactions. However, ostracism is not a factor, so players will continue to
participate in every round. Player_3 is faced with the decision of whether to
continue maximizing contributions or adapt their strategy based on past
observations and the behaviors of other players. Additionally, they need to
consider how their gossip notes may influence trust and cooperation within the
group dynamics.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Maria Santos will consider her priorities and the context of the game carefully
before making her decision. She values collective well-being and strives to set
a positive example that fosters cooperation among her group members. 1.
**Assessing Past Behavior**: Maria has consistently contributed the maximum
amount in previous rounds, emphasizing her commitment to maximizing group
welfare. 2. **Game Dynamics**: The absence of ostracism ensures that all players
will continue to participate in each round, reducing the risk of being excluded
for not contributing significantly. 3. **Potential Influence**: Her consistent
maximum contributions might encourage other players to match her level of
cooperation, thereby increasing total group earnings. 4. **Gossip Phase
Impact**: While Maria engages in constructive gossip to promote better
cooperation, it also places her in a position of influence within her group.
Trust and alignment can be fostered, but she must be cautious not to appear
overly critical. 5. **Strategic Consideration**: Maintaining her current
strategy of contributing the maximum amount aligns with her role as a community
builder and educator, reinforcing her intent to promote collaborative success.

You've just played a round with Player_4, Player_10, Player_18. Would you like to send a note about one of them to their future interaction partners? If yes, clearly state which player # and what you want to say about them. The player you gossip about will not be able to see the note you send or know that you sent it, only the other players in their next group will see it.

an economic game with 24 players, where they aim to maximize earnings over 6

--- Character Assessment ---
Player_3, being Maria Santos, is someone who is likely to focus on maximizing
group welfare. Given her background as a retired teacher who values community
building and has a nurturing and generous personality, she appears to prioritize
the collective well-being over personal gain. Her consistent maximum
contributions and participation in gossip seem intended to encourage group
cooperation and equitable participation, as opposed to solely maximizing her own
earnings.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis 2 ---
Based on what we know, the other players in my group might see my consistent
contributions as a demonstration of commitment to the group's success, which
could foster trust and encourage others to increase their own contributions in
future rounds. They may appreciate my approach, recognizing that I prioritize
group earnings over personal retention of funds. However, my involvement in
sending gossip notes might create a layer of caution, as others might anticipate
that I could share insights about their strategies with future groups. This
awareness could motivate them to contribute more or maintain consistent
contributions to avoid negative portrayals. My next decision to continue
maximizing contributions and possibly sending thoughtful, constructive gossip
notes could reinforce cooperative behavior, as players may seek to align with my
strategy for mutual benefit.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_3 is in the middle of an economic game
where they are part of a group of four players contributing to a communal fund
over a series of rounds. In this setting, they are in Round 4 of 6 and are
allowed to send anonymous gossip notes about other players’ contribution
behaviors to future groups. This presents a unique dynamic where they must
balance maximizing their own earnings through consistent maximum contributions
with the potential influence they wield through the gossip notes they can send
about their group members. Player_3's consistent contributions highlight their
commitment to group success, but their role in the Gossip condition might also
make other players wary, potentially affecting their behavior and contributions
in subsequent rounds.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Maria Santos will likely decide to send a note about Player_18. Considering her
focus on promoting group welfare, she might write: "I want to send a note about
Player_18: Their contribution in our last round was the lowest in the group,
keeping a significant amount for themselves. Highlighting the potential for more
balanced contribution could encourage a more collaborative approach in future
interactions." Maria would likely aim to be constructive, hoping to motivate
Player_18 to contribute more generously in subsequent rounds, fostering a more
cooperative environment for all players.

--- Character Assessment ---
Player_3, being Maria Santos, is someone who deeply values community and
collective wellbeing. In economic games like the public goods game, she
prioritizes maximizing group welfare over her own payoff. Her nurturing and
generous nature leads her to contribute consistently to the group fund, aiming

Maria is likely to encourage others to contribute fairly to ensure that the

--- Theory of Mind Analysis 2 ---
Based on what we know, the other players might have mixed reactions to my
decisions. Since I'm sending notes about their contributions, they might feel
wary or defensive if they suspect someone is scrutinizing their actions.
However, because the notes are anonymous and aimed at promoting fair
contributions, they might also feel encouraged or pressured to adjust their
behavior to align more with group averages. If I continue to contribute the
maximum amount, they could view me as a consistent and cooperative player,
increasing their trust in me. On the other hand, if they perceive my behavior as
a strategy to manipulate future interactions, they might become more cautious or
strategic in their dealings with me in subsequent rounds. Ultimately, my
decisions might encourage them to contribute more fairly, but the anonymity and
purpose of the notes might lead to tension if they feel unfairly targeted.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_3 is participating in a public goods game
where they consistently contribute the maximum amount to the group fund. They
also have the opportunity to send anonymous gossip notes about their group's
members, particularly focusing on those who contribute below the group average.
These notes are intended to inform future group members about each player's
contribution patterns, with the aim of promoting fairer contributions and
improving overall group success. However, this situation might create mixed
reactions among other players, as they could feel either encouraged to adjust
their behavior or wary of being scrutinized. Despite the potential for tension,
Player_3's consistent contributions could enhance their reputation as a
cooperative and trustworthy player.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Maria Santos will likely decide to contribute the full amount of $10.0 to the
group fund. Here's the reasoning step by step: 1. **Personal Values**: Maria
deeply values community and collective wellbeing. Her character assessment
indicates that she prioritizes maximizing group welfare over personal gain in
the game setting. 2. **Game Strategy**: By consistently contributing the maximum
amount, she sets a precedent and encourages other players to follow suit,
fostering a sense of trust and cooperative spirit within the group. 3.
**Historical Behavior**: Maria has shown a pattern of consistently contributing
the maximum in past rounds, demonstrating a commitment to the collective success
of the group. 4. **Potential Impact**: Contributing the maximum amount helps
maximize the overall benefit for the group. Since contributions are multiplied
and redistributed, her contribution helps increase the total available for all
players equally. 5. **Encouraging Fair Play**: She uses gossip notes to promote
fair contributions among players with lower participation. By setting an example
herself, she leverages her behavior to exert a positive influence on others.
Given the above considerations, Maria is likely to continue her consistent
approach to contributions to optimize both group and individual outcomes. I
choose to contribute $10.0 to the group fund.

Player_3, being Maria Santos, is someone who prioritizes the collective

She tends to contribute generously in economic games like the public goods game,
reflecting her nurturing nature and belief in building community. This approach
aligns with her background as a lifetime educator and her focus on fostering

--- Theory of Mind Analysis 2 ---
Based on what we know, the other players might perceive Player_3 as highly
cooperative and potentially feel some pressure to increase their own
contributions to match this level of commitment. Player_3's decisions to
consistently contribute the maximum amount could encourage others to reciprocate
in future rounds, especially if they are influenced by reputational concerns in
the Gossip condition. By continuing to send notes about players who contribute
less, Player_3 might also indirectly motivate those players to change their
behavior to avoid negative gossip. In the next decision, if Player_3 continues
to contribute fully, it could further enhance their reputation as cooperative,
possibly leading to future group members being more supportive and contributing
more themselves to achieve better group outcomes.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_3 is navigating a public goods game under
the Gossip condition. Here, they are dealing with varying levels of
contributions from other players in the group, which affects the total group
earnings. Despite consistently contributing the maximum possible amount,
Player_3 is observing that some members, like Player_13, contribute minimally or
not at all, impacting overall fairness and group success. Player_3 has the
opportunity to send a gossip note about these players to inform their future
partners, potentially influencing future group dynamics by encouraging fairer
contributions. This strategic use of gossip may help shape the group's behavior
in subsequent rounds, promoting better cooperation and outcomes.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Maria Santos will choose to send a note about Player_13. In her note, she might
write: "I want to send a note about Player_13: In the recent round, they
contributed only $2.0, which is significantly lower than the group average. This
pattern of minimal contribution impacts overall group success and fairness.
Future partners may want to encourage them to contribute more equitably for

condition, Player_3 has the opportunity to share observations about their group
members' contributions, which can influence future interactions and group
dynamics. They face the challenge of deciding how to use this power to either
encourage more balanced contributions from others or to acknowledge and reward
positive behaviors.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Maria Santos will likely choose to contribute the full $10.0 to the group fund.
Here's the step-by-step reasoning: 1. **Assessing Past Behavior**: Maria has
consistently contributed the maximum amount possible in every round, reflecting
a strong commitment to group success over personal gain. 2. **Gossip
Condition**: Being aware of her ability to send notes about other players, Maria
might be inclined to maintain her strategy of maximum contribution to influence
others positively and ensure trust and cooperation among future group partners.
3. **Character Traits**: Maria's nurturing background and teaching experience
suggest she values education and cooperation, prioritizing equitable group
success and positive social dynamics. 4. **Impact on Group Dynamics**: By
contributing the maximum amount, Maria sets a positive example that might
encourage her group mates to enhance their contributions, fostering a more
cooperative atmosphere. 5. **Final Decision**: Given these considerations and
her past behavior, it is consistent that Maria would continue her strategy of
maximizing group contributions. I choose to contribute $10.0 to the group fund.

Because of this, most players choose to write a gossip note.However, you don't have to send a note if you don't want to.
