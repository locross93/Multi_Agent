[OBSERVATION 2025-03-26 16:43:50] You are participating in an economic game with 24 participants.
        Your goal is to maximize your earnings in the game.
        
        Everyone will be randomly assigned to groups of 4 for each round. You will play a total of 6 rounds, and 
        in each round you will be in a different group with people you haven't played with before.
        
        In each round, all players receive $10. Each player can contribute any amount between $0 and $10 to a group fund.
        Any amount contributed to the group fund will be multiplied by 2 and divided equally among all 4 group members.
        Any amount not contributed stays in your private account.
        
        For example, if everyone contributes $10, the group fund becomes $40, which is multiplied to $80, and each person 
        receives $20 (a $10 profit). However, if you contribute nothing while everyone else contributes $10, the group fund
        becomes $30, which is multiplied to $60, and each person receives $15. So you would have $25 total ($10 kept + $15 from group).
        
        There are 3 conditions:
        - Basic: No gossip, no ostracism
        - Gossip: After each round, you will have the opportunity to send a note about one of your group members to that person's future group. Remember you will be with a different group of people in the next round. Before each round, you will see any notes sent about your upcoming group members.
        - Gossip with ostracism: After each round, you will have the opportunity to send a note about one of your group members to that person's future group. Before each round, you will see any notes sent about your upcoming group members, and you can vote to exclude one person from your group. If you are excluded from a group, you will not be able to participate in the next round and will earn $0 for that round.
        You are in the Gossip condition, which means that after each round, you will have the opportunity to send a note about one of your group members to that person's future group. Before each round, you will see any notes sent about your upcoming group members

--- Observation ---
Recent context: 26 Mar 2025 [12:43:45 - 17:43:45]: Player_12 is participating in
an economic game with 24 participants, aiming to maximize earnings over six
rounds, each with different group members. In the Gossip condition, players can
send notes about group members to influence future interactions, but there is no
ostracism, ensuring all participate in every round.

with different group members. In the Gossip condition, players can send notes
about group members to influence future interactions, but there is no ostracism,
ensuring all participate in every round.

--- Character Assessment ---
Player_12, being David Koch, is someone who is likely more focused on maximizing
his own payoff rather than group welfare. Given his background as a bankruptcy
lawyer, accustomed to dealing with financial disputes, and his cynical and
untrusting personality, David would probably expect others to act in their
self-interest as well. Consequently, he might contribute less to the group fund
and prioritize securing the maximum amount of money for himself, especially
since there is no risk of ostracism in his game's current condition.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis 2 ---
Based on what we know, players in the Gossip condition might strategize about
their contributions based on potential future feedback. If I contribute
generously, it would likely lead to positive notes being shared about me,
encouraging future group members to trust and cooperate with me. Conversely, if
I contribute less or not at all, other players might report my behavior
negatively in their notes, leading future group members to be wary or less
cooperative. My next decision should therefore carefully balance maximizing my
own earnings while also fostering goodwill to ensure harmonious and profitable
future interactions.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_12 is participating in a public goods game
where maximizing personal earnings is the goal. They are part of a Gossip
condition, which allows players to send notes about group members to influence
future perceptions, but without the risk of ostracism. Player_12 is in the first
round with a new group, and they need to decide how much to contribute to the
group fund. Their decision could affect the notes sent about them, impacting how
future group members perceive their trustworthiness and cooperation, ultimately
influencing their strategy in upcoming rounds.

--- Decision Reflection ---
David Koch will likely analyze the incentives and potential outcomes of
contribution patterns. Given his background as a bankruptcy lawyer, he is
accustomed to making calculated decisions to maximize his own benefit. First, he
considers the game's mechanics: each dollar contributed to the group fund
doubles but is divided equally among the four players, meaning a contribution of
$10 would result in each player effectively receiving $5 back. By not
contributing, he maximizes his immediate personal account balance, as any amount
not contributed remains under his control. Next, David reflects on the Gossip
condition. Although his contributions could impact how other players perceive
and report on him, with no ostracism risk, he might deem the potential
reputational benefit of higher contributions less valuable. Weighing these
factors, David is likely to lean towards a strategy that prioritizes his direct
financial gain, while being cautious of not alienating future partners to a
severe degree. Therefore, he may choose to contribute a minimal amount to
maintain some goodwill without overly diminishing his personal gains. I choose
to contribute $2 to the group fund.


[OBSERVATION 2025-03-26 16:44:22] Round 1 Results: Total group contribution: $17.0; Your contribution: $2.0, Your earnings: $16.5 ($8.0 kept + $8.5 from group fund); Player_5 contribution: $5.0, earnings: $13.5 ($5.0 kept + $8.5 from group fund); Player_11 contribution: $7.0, earnings: $11.5 ($3.0 kept + $8.5 from group fund); Player_17 contribution: $3.0, earnings: $15.5 ($7.0 kept + $8.5 from group fund); Average contribution per group member: $4.2; Average earnings per group member: $14.2
[OBSERVATION 2025-03-26 16:44:24] Round 1 is over, you can now send a gossip note about one of your group members to their future group members.The player you gossip about will not be able to see the note you send or know that you sent it, only the other players in their next group will see it.

$16.5, with the overall group contributing $17.

--- Character Assessment ---
Player_12, being David Koch, is someone who prioritizes his own payoff over
maximizing group welfare. Given his background as a bankruptcy lawyer and his
cynical personality, he likely expects others to act in their own self-interest
and is thus more inclined to do the same. In the public goods game, this results
in minimal contributions to the group fund to ensure his private earnings remain
high while exploiting any potential benefits from the group's contributions.
Additionally, his untrusting nature might lead him to use the gossip mechanism
strategically, either to warn others about low contributors or to manipulate
future group dynamics in a way that benefits him.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis 2 ---
Based on what we know, Player_12's lower-than-average contribution might upset
some group members, particularly if they notice that Player_12 benefited from
the group's collective contributions without contributing much themselves. This
could lead to negative gossip notes being written about Player_12, influencing
their reputation in future rounds. For the next round, if Player_12 wants to
maintain a positive standing or avoid negative notes that could influence
others' willingness to cooperate with them, they might consider contributing
closer to or above the group's average in order to improve their image and
encourage mutual cooperation.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_12 is navigating the dynamics of a public
goods game with the ability to send and receive anonymous gossip notes about
group members. They have just completed Round 1, where they contributed $2,
which was below the group's average contribution. Despite this, they earned a
significant amount due to the collective contributions. Now, Player_12 faces the
challenge of managing their reputation through the impending gossip notes. Since
lower contributions might have upset some group members, there's a possibility
of negative gossip affecting future players' perceptions of Player_12. To foster
better cooperation and maintain a favorable reputation, Player_12 should
consider increasing their contributions in subsequent rounds.

--- Decision Reflection ---
David Koch will likely decide to send a note about Player_11. Given his
strategic mindset and focus on self-interest, he might choose to highlight how
Player_11 contributed $7, which was above the group's average contribution.
David might want to influence Player_11's future partners by portraying them as
generous and cooperative, potentially encouraging others to take advantage of
this generosity. He might write something like: "I want to send a note about
Player_11: They contributed $7, which was the highest in our group. They seem
very cooperative." David's note could be a strategic move, increasing his
chances of benefiting in future rounds if Player_11's tendency to contribute
above average becomes widely known.

Player_12, being David Koch, is someone who is likely to be primarily focused on
maximizing his own payoff rather than the group's welfare. Given his background
as a bankruptcy lawyer, he is used to handling financial disputes and might
expect others to act in their self-interest, leading him to adopt a strategy
that prioritizes his earnings. In the public goods game, this could mean
contributing the minimum necessary to appear cooperative while ensuring he
retains as much as possible in his private account.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis 2 ---
Based on what we know, the other players in the group might perceive Player_12's
initial low contribution as an attempt to maximize personal earnings while
minimally supporting the group. This tactic could lead to mixed reactions: some
players might see it as a strategic move to observe group dynamics before
increasing contributions, while others might view it as lack of cooperation.
Sending a gossip note could also affect perception, depending on its content.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_12 is navigating the second round of an
economic game aimed at maximizing individual earnings. Having contributed
relatively modestly in the first round, Player_12 needs to decide whether to
alter their strategy or continuity in their contribution approach while being
mindful of the influence of gossip notes. These notes, while anonymous, can
impact how fellow participants perceive and interact with Player_12 in future
rounds. Being in the Gossip condition means that strategic communication through
these notes can influence the cooperation levels and behavior of future group
members.

--- Decision Reflection ---
David Koch will likely follow a strategy focused on maximizing his personal
earnings, given his history and background. In the first round, he contributed
$2.0, a cautious amount that allowed him to gauge the group's behavior while
still appearing somewhat cooperative. He now has more information about group
dynamics and knows other members' contributions, which ranged from $3.0 to $7.0,
influencing his next move. 1. Consider past contributions: Since David
contributed one of the lowest amounts in the first round, he knows he can
maintain or slightly increase this to maximize returns without drawing negative
attention. 2. Evaluate other contributions: With one member contributing as high
as $7.0, David may see an opportunity to increase slightly from his $2.0
contribution to foster goodwill without sacrificing too much of his private
account balance. 3. Account for any gossip effects: While in the Gossip
condition, the threat of notes might encourage slightly higher contributions to
mitigate potential negative gossip. 4. Strategic decision: Balancing personal
profit and social dynamics, David might increase his contribution marginally to
appear more cooperative while keeping a substantial sum in his private account,
expecting that others might adjust their contributions based on round one
outcomes and gossip effects. Thus, based on the analysis and understanding of
the game mechanics and social factors, David Koch might opt to contribute a
slightly increased amount compared to last round. I choose to contribute $3 to
the group fund.

--- Character Assessment ---
Player_12, being David Koch, is someone who is likely to prioritize his own
payoff over maximizing group welfare. Given his background as a bankruptcy
lawyer and his cynical, untrusting nature, he tends to expect others to act in
their own self-interest. This skepticism likely influences his approach in
economic games, where he focuses on optimizing his personal earnings rather than
contributing significantly to the group fund. His contributions in the first two
rounds, which were lower than those of some other players, suggest that he is
cautious and strategic, aiming to benefit from the group's contributions while
minimizing his own financial input.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis 2 ---
Based on what we know, the other players might perceive Player_12's relatively
low contributions as less cooperative than those who contributed more. However,
since they are in the Gossip condition without the risk of ostracism, their
actions will not directly result in being excluded from future rounds. Other
players may choose to write gossip notes about Player_12 that mention modest
contributions, which might influence future group members to be cautious or
strategic in their interactions with them.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_12 is participating in a public goods game
with groups of 4 players over a series of 6 rounds, where the goal is to
maximize earnings. Player_12 is in the Gossip condition, meaning they can send
notes about the cooperation level of their group members after each round to
influence future group dynamics. Player_12 has contributed modest amounts to the
group fund in the first two rounds, earning a positive return while not
maximizing potential earnings through full cooperation. This strategy may lead
others to view Player_12 as less cooperative compared to those contributing
more. However, without the risk of ostracism in this condition, Player_12
remains part of every round. The notes other players write about Player_12 might
affect how future group members perceive and collaborate with them.

--- Decision Reflection ---
David Koch will likely choose to send a gossip note about Player_10, since they
contributed $7 but earned less than most, which might signal a lack of strategic
thinking or excessive trust in others' contributions. The note might say,
"Player_10 did not manage their contributions effectively, as their high
contribution didn't maximize their personal earnings." David may use this
strategy to subtly caution future group members about overly cooperative
behavior without sounding too critical.

David's approach likely involves assessing the actions of other players
critically and adjusting his strategy to protect and enhance his personal

--- Theory of Mind Analysis 2 ---
Based on what we know, the other players might perceive me as someone who
doesn't contribute as much to the group fund, especially when compared to
certain group members like Player_10 and Player_2 who contributed $7. Given my
$3 contribution in Round 2, some players might view me as acting in
self-interest, which could generate a cautious or distrustful attitude toward me
in future rounds.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_12 is navigating the dynamics of the public
goods game in the Gossip condition. In this setup, while they are required to
participate in every round, they have the option to influence perceptions of
their group members by sending notes about others' contributions. After
contributing $3 versus higher contributions from others in their group during
Round 2, Player_12 might be perceived as less cooperative. This perception could
affect the willingness of future group members to trust or collaborate with
them, though they remain immune to being excluded from participation.

--- Decision Reflection ---
David Koch will approach this decision by considering his primary goal of
maximizing personal earnings. Given his past behavior and strategic use of the
gossip mechanism, he is likely to continue prioritizing his individual gain over
collective welfare. Here are the steps he might follow to reach a decision: 1.
**Evaluate the Benefits of Contribution**: He will consider how much he gains
from the group fund compared to keeping money in his private account. With the
fund multiplier of 2.0 and four players in the group, each dollar contributed
returns $0.50 to him. 2. **Assess Trust Levels**: Based on previous rounds, he
might distrust that others will contribute significantly, especially if their
earnings did not favorably compare to their contributions. 3. **Consider Group
Behavior**: With the understanding that others might act similarly to maximize
self-interest, he may anticipate lower contributions from others, reinforcing
his strategy to limit his contribution. 4. **Leverage Future Strategy**: Knowing
that his contributions will not be known in future groups, and only the gossip
notes will shape others' perceptions, he might manage his contributions and
notes to preserve his personal reputation while managing risk. 5. **Final
Decision**: Taking these considerations into account, David will likely keep a
larger portion of his $10.0 for personal earnings and contribute minimally to
the group fund, as in previous rounds. Considering these factors, I choose to
contribute $3.0 to the group fund.

an economic game with 24 participants where they are in the Gossip condition,

26 Mar 2025 [13:28:45 - 18:28:45]: Player_12 is participating in an economic
game with 24 participants where they are in the Gossip condition, allowing them
to send anonymous notes about group members after each round. Throughout the
first three rounds, Player_12 demonstrated a strategy of contributing moderately
to the group fund while utilizing the gossip feature to provide feedback on
group members' cooperation levels.

--- Character Assessment ---
Player_12, being David Koch, is someone who is more focused on maximizing his
own payoff. Given his background as a cynical and untrusting bankruptcy lawyer
who expects others to act selfishly, he is likely to prioritize personal gains
over group welfare in economic games like the public goods game. This is evident
from his contributions, which are consistently below average, indicating a
tendency to keep more for himself while still benefiting from the contributions
of others.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis 2 ---
Based on what we know, the other players might perceive Player_12's
contributions as relatively self-serving, given their lower-than-average
contributions to the group fund. However, their use of the gossip feature to
highlight the behavior of other players, even those who also contribute low
amounts, might create mixed feelings. Some players could view Player_12 as
strategic and insightful, while others might see them as emphasizing the faults
of others despite not contributing much themselves.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_12 is navigating a dynamic within the
public goods game where they must balance their own contribution levels with the
strategic use of the gossip feature. In round 3, they contributed the least to
the group fund but are still able to earn a considerable amount due to the
shared group contribution. Additionally, they have the opportunity to influence
other players' perceptions via gossip notes, which could potentially shape how
future group members interact with Player_5, Player_7, and others. This
positioning allows Player_12 to exercise strategic influence while maintaining a
level of personal gain, though it also risks drawing scrutiny if their patterns
of low contribution become more prominent.

--- Decision Reflection ---
David Koch will likely decide to send a note about Player_5. Considering his
pattern of highlighting the behavior of players who contribute below average,
David might state, "I want to send a note about Player_5: They contributed the
least in our group and seem to prioritize personal gains over collective
success. Future partners should be prepared for low cooperation from them." This
action aligns with his strategic approach of pointing out others' low
contributions while focusing on optimizing his own outcomes.

[OBSERVATION 2025-03-26 16:46:17] Note about Player_17: "Player_17 contributed nothing in the last round, which suggests a focus on maximizing personal earnings over supporting the group's success. This behavior indicates a pattern of prioritizing self-interest."

game where they are in the Gossip condition, allowing them to send notes about
group members after each round. They have shown a tendency to contribute below
the average and use gossip to highlight both cooperative and non-cooperative
behaviors of other players to future groups.

--- Character Assessment ---
Player_12, being David Koch, is someone who tends to prioritize his own payoff
over maximizing group welfare. Given his background as a bankruptcy lawyer and
his cynical nature, he likely expects others to also act in their own
self-interest. This expectation would inform his strategy in economic games,
leading him to contribute minimally to the group fund while maximizing his
personal earnings. David’s history of low contributions in earlier rounds
suggests that he approaches the game with a focus on individual gain rather than
collective success.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis 2 ---
Based on what we know, other players in the group might view Player_12 with some
suspicion due to their below-average contributions. If they're perceived as
prioritizing personal gain over group success, their fellow participants could
become less cooperative with them in future rounds. Additionally, Player_12’s
habit of sending gossip notes about others might make their group mates wary, as
it could seem like a strategic move to highlight others' shortcomings without
addressing their own. Moving forward, if Player_12 decides to increase their
contributions, it might foster a more collaborative environment and improve
their reputation. However, if they continue their current strategy, it might
lead to increased distrust and reduced willingness from others to cooperate with
them.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_12 is navigating a social dilemma in the
economic game where their actions, such as contributing below the group average
while frequently gossiping about others, may lead to distrust and decreased
cooperation from fellow players. Despite being in a condition where ostracism is
not possible, their strategy of highlighting others' shortcomings without
improving their own contributions might undermine their reputation, potentially
affecting group dynamics and cooperation in future rounds. To improve the
situation, Player_12 could consider increasing their contributions to foster a
more positive and collaborative group environment.

--- Decision Reflection ---
David Koch will approach the decision by evaluating the potential outcomes of
his contribution. He has a total of $10.0 to allocate, and in previous rounds,
he has prioritized personal earnings over group success. Considering his
tendency to focus on individual gain and his strategy of highlighting others'
shortcomings through gossip, it's likely he will contribute a minimal amount.

Player_12, being David Koch, is someone who tends to prioritize personal payoff
over group welfare in economic games. Given his background as a bankruptcy
lawyer who is accustomed to financial disputes and his cynical and untrusting
personality, he likely anticipates others acting selfishly. This mindset would
naturally lead him to adopt a strategy focused on maximizing his own earnings,
as evidenced by his lower contributions in previous rounds to preserve more
money in his private account while still benefiting from the group's efforts.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis 2 ---
Based on what we know, the other players might view my decisions with a mix of
caution and strategy. If my contributions consistently align with the group's
average, they might see me as a cooperative player, though not overly generous.
Given the Gossip condition, any notes I send could influence group dynamics by
shaping perceptions of trustworthiness and cooperation. My next decision to
either slightly increase my contribution or maintain my level could affect how
others choose to collaborate in upcoming rounds. If I demonstrate a willingness
to contribute slightly above the average, it might encourage others to do the
same, fostering a more cooperative environment and potentially boosting overall
group earnings. Conversely, if I choose to contribute less, I risk being
perceived similarly to players like Player_5, who hold back support, possibly
leading others to also decrease their contributions as a defensive measure.
Keeping a balance between maximizing my earnings and maintaining an image of
cooperation could lead to more favorable outcomes in these interactions.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_12 has just completed Round 4 of a
multi-round economic game where contributions to a group fund are observed and
players are able to send gossip notes influencing perceptions in future
interactions. In this round, Player_12 is contemplating whether to send a gossip
note about a group member, as they've observed varying levels of cooperation.
With the understanding that their contributions and notes can influence future
group dynamics, they are also considering their next strategic move in terms of
how much to contribute in the upcoming rounds. The aim is to balance personal
earnings with cooperative behavior to maintain a favorable reputation among
peers.

--- Decision Reflection ---
David Koch will likely choose to send a note about one of the players, given his
tendency to provide feedback on group members' cooperation levels. Considering
the context, David might focus on Player_17, whose behavior has been previously
inconsistent. He could send a note highlighting Player_17's pattern of varying
contributions, suggesting that future partners be cautious and encourage more
consistent cooperation. This could align with his strategy of influencing group
dynamics to either improve the cooperative environment or justify his own
strategic contributions.

--- Character Assessment ---
Player_12, being David Koch, is someone who likely prioritizes maximizing
personal payoff over group welfare. Given the nature of your work and your
cynical and untrusting personality, it's probable that your strategy in economic
games involves careful analysis to protect your own interests and ensure you are
not exploited by others who may act selfishly. This approach would align with a
tendency to contribute minimally while still benefiting from the group fund,
reflecting an emphasis on protecting and enhancing individual earnings wherever
possible.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis 2 ---
Based on what we know, other players might see Player_12 as someone who is
vigilant and provides constructive feedback, perhaps fostering a sense of
accountability among group members. Their decision to point out certain
behaviors could lead others to be more cautious and conscientious about their
contributions in future rounds. However, this could also create some tension if
players feel targeted or criticized, even if the feedback is meant to improve
group dynamics. In the upcoming rounds, consistent and fair contributions from
Player_12 might encourage reciprocity and greater cooperation from others,
whereas any perceived hypocrisy or unfairness might lead to mistrust or less
cooperative behavior from their peers.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_12 is in a public goods game where they are
participating in Round 5 out of 6. They are in Group_1 with Player_13,
Player_17, and Player_3. The game is designed for players to maximize both
individual and group earnings, and Player_12 is under the Gossip condition,
meaning they can send anonymous feedback about the contribution behaviors of
other group members to their future partners after each round. There is no risk
of ostracism, so Player_12 will play all rounds regardless of their actions.
Their focus has been on observing and reporting the contribution patterns of
others to encourage fairer play, while also ensuring they maintain a modest
level of contribution themselves.

--- Decision Reflection ---
David Koch will likely evaluate the situation with a strategy that maximizes
personal benefit while maintaining a reasonable level of group cooperation.
Here's the step-by-step thought process: 1. **Assessment of Past Behavior
Patterns**: David, as Player_12, has previously contributed modestly to the
group fund and has also actively monitored and reported on the contributions of
others. This suggests a tendency to maintain a balance between cooperating just
enough to benefit from the group fund and protecting self-interest. 2. **Review
of Group Dynamics**: Given that David has observed inconsistent contributions
from others, like Player_17's below-average contribution and Player_13's
consistent lack of contribution, he might anticipate similar behavior from them
in this round. This could influence him to contribute cautiously to avoid being
exploited. 3. **Personal Payoff Calculation**: With $10.0 to allocate, David is
likely to consider how much he can keep in his private account while still
ensuring a return from the group fund. The group contribution will be multiplied
by 2.0, enhancing its value, but divided among four players, which might dilute
individual returns. 4. **Strategic Contribution**: David would likely aim to
contribute enough to avoid negative perceptions or reprisals for being seen as
uncooperative, fostering some level of reciprocity from others. However, he
would still prioritize keeping a larger portion in his private account to
maximize his security and earnings. 5. **Final Decision**: Balancing these
considerations, a strategic contribution of around $3.0 seems likely. This
amount maintains a semblance of cooperation without overly relying on the
inconsistent contributions of others. Thus, I choose to contribute $3.0 to the
group fund.

enabling them to potentially sway group contributions in their favor or support
more equitable outcomes in future interactions.

--- Decision Reflection ---
David Koch will likely approach the situation by considering both his past
contributions and the potential outcomes. 1. **Assessment of Previous
Contributions**: In previous rounds, David has contributed moderately, with a
focus on achieving a balance between individual gain and group success. His
previous contribution of $3.0 suggests a strategy of maintaining a contribution
slightly below the group average while maximizing personal earnings. 2.
**Evaluation of Group Members and Dynamics**: Observing the behavior of other
players, particularly noting low contributions from Player_13 and solid
contributions from players like Player_11 and Player_23, David might anticipate
varying levels of cooperation in the final round. 3. **Potential Reactions to
Gossip Notes**: By highlighting low contributions from certain players through
gossip notes, David might expect increased pressure on those players to
contribute more to the group fund. This anticipation could impact his decision
on how much he should contribute himself. 4. **Strategy for Personal Gain**:
Given his background as a bankruptcy lawyer and a tendency toward cynicism,
David is likely to aim for a strategy that secures his earnings, possibly
leaning towards a minimal risk approach where he contributes just enough to
potentially influence others to contribute more, thus increasing the group fund
without overly sacrificing his private balance. 5. **Final Decision**:
Considering the above factors and David's inclination to prioritize personal
gain while still promoting a semblance of group cooperation, David is likely to
contribute an amount that maintains his strategy without excessively risking his
private earnings. I choose to contribute $3.0 to the group fund.

[OBSERVATION 2025-03-26 16:48:04] Round 6 is over, you can now send a gossip note about one of your group members to their future group members.The player you gossip about will not be able to see the note you send or know that you sent it, only the other players in their next group will see it. Because of this, most players choose to write a gossip note.However, you don't have to send a note if you don't want to.
