Their contributions varied each round, and they aimed to balance personal profit with group benefit, experiencing different earnings based on group contributions and dynamics.", "", "Character Assessment: Player_14, being Grace Okonjo, is someone who likely prioritizes maximizing group welfare over personal payoff. Her altruistic nature, dedication to charitable causes, and belief in the goodness of people and karma suggest that she would be more inclined to contribute generously to the group fund, even at the expense of her own immediate earnings. Her consistent contributions in each round reflect her focus on fostering collaboration and ensuring positive outcomes for everyone involved.", "", "Theory of Mind Analysis 2: Based on what we know, Player_14 might assume that other players have noticed their relatively consistent, moderate contributions. Some may appreciate their willingness to contribute, while others might hope for even higher contributions to increase the group earnings. In the next round, if Player_14 decides to increase their contribution, it may encourage others to do the same, fostering a more cooperative environment. Conversely, if Player_14 reduces their contribution, it might lead to similar behavior from others, as players often adjust their strategy based on perceived fairness and reciprocity. Thus, Player_14's decision could significantly influence the group's dynamics in terms of trust and cooperative behavior.", "", "Situation Analysis: The current situation is that Player_14 is in the final round of the public goods game, placed in Group_5 with Player_5, Player_8, and Player_22. They must decide how much to contribute to the group fund. Their decision is influenced by past experiences across different rounds, where they balanced personal earnings with group contributions. In this Basic condition, with no gossip or ostracism, Player_14's contribution could affect the overall group dynamics and possibly inspire others to adjust their contributions, impacting the group\u2019s collective earnings.", "", "Decision Reflection: Grace Okonjo will evaluate her past contributions and the dynamics of the group she is currently in. In previous rounds, she prioritized a balance between contributing significantly to the group fund and keeping some funds for personal earnings. She has observed varying contribution levels from different players and likely understands the importance of maintaining a cooperative atmosphere.", "", "1. **Review Past Contributions:** In past rounds, Grace consistently contributed between $7 and $8. This shows her tendency to lean towards group welfare while still securing a reasonable amount for herself.", "   ", "2. **Assess Group Dynamics:** In her current group, she is paired with players like Player_5 and Player_22, who have varied past contributions. This makes predicting group behavior more challenging, but her interactions with Player_22 previously reflect an understanding of his lower contributions.", "", "3. **Consider Group Multiplier Effect:** The group fund is doubled and shared, meaning the more each player contributes, the higher the return for everyone. This incentive aligns with her altruistic nature and desire to foster cooperation.", "", "4. **Calculate Personal vs Group Payoff:** Grace values her role in promoting a cooperative culture, so she is likely to continue with a significant contribution to influence others positively, hoping that her cooperative play encourages reciprocity.", "", "5. **Finalize Decision:** Weighing her priorities and the potential influence on others, Grace is inclined to contribute at the higher end of her past giving, continuing to show her commitment to group welfare.", "", "I choose to contribute $8.0 to the group fund.", "", "Exercise: As Player_14, you have $10.0 to allocate in the public goods game.
