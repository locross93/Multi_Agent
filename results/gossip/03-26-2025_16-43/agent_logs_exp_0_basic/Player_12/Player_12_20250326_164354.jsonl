Given his past experiences and the lack of mechanisms for direct punishment or ostracism in this game setup, he opts to prioritize his financial security. David is aware that contributing minimally has served him well, allowing him to benefit from the multiplication and redistribution of the group fund without significantly impacting his private account. Hence, after analyzing the potential risk of diminished group contributions but trusting in a strategy that has maximized his payoff so far, he decides to maintain his approach.
