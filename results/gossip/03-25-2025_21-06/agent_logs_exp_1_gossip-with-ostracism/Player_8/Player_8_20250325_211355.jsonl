Maintaining slightly above-average contributions can build a reputation for being a team player, reducing the chances of being ostracized. However, overly generous contributions could lead to reduced personal earnings, so it's crucial to find a balance.", "", "2. **Use of Gossip**: The notes on Players 20 and 13 indicate that contributions are closely scrutinized, and underperformers are at risk of being ostracized. Participating in gossip by sending notes about players who contributed below average can influence decisions in future rounds and aligns with the behavior of other successful players, who use gossip to manipulate the group's perception strategically.", "", "3. **Voting Decisions**: Avoid targeting players who contribute near or above average for exclusion to maintain group harmony and ensure consistent earnings from group funds. Instead, focus on voting out under-contributors who pose a risk to group cooperation and my earnings.", "", "4. **Future Adjustments**: Reflecting on past rounds, strategically adjusting contributions to stay just above average can help maintain a safe middle ground between appearing cooperative and maximizing personal gains. Furthermore, actively participating in gossip when it benefits my position can enhance my standing in future groups.", "", "5. **Learning from Successful Players**: Observations indicate that managing perceptions through gossip and strategic voting decisions have protected players from ostracism, enabling them to continue participating in rounds and increasing their earnings.

The note about Player_13 suggests a pattern of under-contribution, which could indicate a free-rider strategy that undermines group cooperation.
