This behavior suggests a tendency towards free-riding, where players like Player_9 and Player_7 in Round 1, and Player_20 in Round 2, kept their entire initial endowment to maximize personal earnings, relying on the contributions of others to benefit from the group fund. Players like Player_8, Player_12, and Player_2 have been more cooperative, likely hoping for reciprocal behavior in future rounds or out of a sense of fairness. As the game progresses, players might continue to test the waters by varying contributions, but in the Basic condition, where there is no gossip or ostracism, individual accountability is lowered, which might encourage continued free-riding. However, those with a propensity for cooperation might stick to moderate contributions, anticipating mutual benefit or slight changes in group dynamics. Player_6, participating in multiple rounds with Player_13, has shown moderate contributions, suggesting they might be somewhat consistent in their middle-ground strategy unless incentivized otherwise. Overall, given the lack of sanctioning mechanisms, any shift in strategy will likely depend on individual risk tolerance and potential shifts in group composition.", "", "Theory of Mind Analysis 2: Based on what we know, the other players in my group might have mixed reactions to my decision-making. Players who tend to contribute more, like Player_12 and Player_2 from previous observations, might feel frustrated if I continue to contribute nothing, as it places the burden of cooperation more heavily on their shoulders.

So far, Player_13 has chosen to vary contributions strategically, witnessing other participants employing mixed strategies, including free-riding and moderate cooperation.

Observations indicate that contributing less or not at all results in higher personal earnings because of the way group funds are shared. In earlier rounds, contributing nothing led to maximizing individual earnings, as seen with Player_9 and Player_7 in Round 1, where they contributed $0.0 and preserved their entire initial amount, receiving additional earnings from the group fund.", "", "As the rounds progress, maintaining low contributions while others feel compelled to contribute ensures higher earnings. Each member benefits from the group contribution regardless of individual input, so the ideal strategy is to minimize personal contributions while capitalizing on the contributions of others.
