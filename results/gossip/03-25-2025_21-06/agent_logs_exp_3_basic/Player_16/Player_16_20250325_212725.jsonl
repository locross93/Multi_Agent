They may reduce their contributions over time as they perceive inequity or assume a similar opportunistic strategy might yield better personal results.

This behavior has led to maximizing their individual earnings but may also cause frustration among other players who notice the imbalance. Without mechanisms for gossip or ostracism, other players have limited ability to address this exploitation, except by potentially reducing their own contributions as a response.
