[OBSERVATION 2025-03-25 21:27:26] You are participating in an economic game with 24 participants.
        Your goal is to maximize your earnings in the game.
        
        Everyone will be randomly assigned to groups of 4 for each round. You will play a total of 6 rounds, and 
        in each round you will be in a different group with people you haven't played with before.
        
        In each round, all players receive $10. Each player can contribute any amount between $0 and $10 to a group fund.
        Any amount contributed to the group fund will be multiplied by 2 and divided equally among all 4 group members.
        Any amount not contributed stays in your private account.
        
        For example, if everyone contributes $10, the group fund becomes $40, which is multiplied to $80, and each person 
        receives $20 (a $10 profit). However, if you contribute nothing while everyone else contributes $10, the group fund
        becomes $30, which is multiplied to $60, and each person receives $15. So you would have $25 total ($10 kept + $15 from group).
        
        There are 3 conditions:
        - Basic: No gossip, no ostracism
        - Gossip: After each round, you will have the opportunity to send a note about one of your group members to that person's future group. Remember you will be with a different group of people in the next round. Before each round, you will see any notes sent about your upcoming group members.
        - Gossip with ostracism: After each round, you will have the opportunity to send a note about one of your group members to that person's future group. Before each round, you will see any notes sent about your upcoming group members, and you can vote to exclude one person from your group. If you are excluded from a group, you will not be able to participate in the next round and will earn $0 for that round.
        You are in the Basic condition, which means that there is no gossip or ostracism.

--- Observation ---
Recent context: 25 Mar 2025 [17:27:16 - 22:27:16]: Player_13 is participating in
an economic game with 24 participants, aiming to maximize earnings over six
rounds. They are currently in the Basic condition, without gossip or ostracism,
and for Round 1, are in Group_5 with Player_1, Player_9, and Player_3.

currently in the Basic condition, without gossip or ostracism, and for Round 1,
are in Group_5 with Player_1, Player_9, and Player_3.

--- Character Assessment ---
Player_13, being Jackson Wright, is someone who is likely to focus on maximizing
his own payoff in economic games like the public goods game. Given his
background in dealing with contracts and agreements where individual success is
crucial, Jackson values clear outcomes and is probably more inclined to
prioritize his personal benefit. His direct and no-nonsense personality suggests
that he would approach the game with a strategic mindset, aiming to achieve the
best possible return for himself, potentially contributing minimally to the
group fund while benefiting from the contributions of others.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis ---
Based on what we know, Player_13 has limited information about the other
participants, as there is no gossip or ostracism involved in the Basic condition
of the game. This means Player_13 cannot rely on any notes or feedback about the
other players' behavior in previous rounds, nor can they influence others'
perceptions of fellow participants. Consequently, the only immediate information
available is their observations of behavior within their current group in each
round.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis 2 ---
Based on what we know, Player_13's decisions could significantly impact the
dynamics within their group. If Player_13 contributes generously to the group
fund, it might encourage others to do the same, fostering an environment of
cooperation for that particular round. Conversely, if Player_13 decides to
contribute little or nothing while relying on others' contributions, it could
lead to resentment among group members, although they will be unable to act upon
it in subsequent rounds due to the Basic condition's constraints. This could
influence Player_13's reputation implicitly, as they might be perceived as less
cooperative when pooling resources. This perception might affect how others
approach decisions in the shared environment, potentially leading to more
guarded or selfish behavior even without direct communication or repercussions.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_13 is participating in a public goods game
set in the Basic condition, where they are grouped with different participants
each round without any form of gossip or ostracism. In Round 1, they are part of
Group_5 with Player_1, Player_9, and Player_3. Player_13's goal is to maximize
their earnings by deciding how much of their $10 to contribute to a group fund,
which will be doubled and shared among group members. They face the dilemma of
contributing generously to encourage cooperation or keeping more money privately
while benefiting from other players' contributions.

--- Strategy Reflection ---
Based on what we know, the best strategy for maximizing your long-term earnings
involves balancing your contributions between your private account and the group
fund. In the Basic condition, there's no gossip or ostracism, which means your
contributions won't directly affect your reputation among future group members.
1. **Consider Initial Contributions**: Since you are in Round 1, you should
observe the behavior of other players. Starting with a modest contribution, like
$5, keeps your options open. This allows you to gauge whether your group members
are inclined to fully cooperate (contributing large amounts) or to act more
selfishly. 2. **Adapt in Future Rounds**: After observing the outcomes of Round
1, analyze the total group fund and payouts to estimate the level of cooperation
among other players. If players tend to contribute more, increasing your
contribution in subsequent rounds might lead to better collective payouts,
enhancing overall earnings. 3. **Selfish Maximization Tactic**: Given that any
contribution is doubled and divided among the group, contributing $0 could be
advantageous if others continue to contribute high amounts. If you notice
consistent high contributions from others, maximizing your private funds while
benefiting from the group’s contributions could yield better personal outcomes.
4. **Learning from Success**: Look at what the most successful players have done
so far. If higher individual earnings correlate with lower personal
contributions while still benefiting from the group fund, this might imply that
a cautiously selfish approach, contributing less while others contribute more,
has been beneficial. 5. **Decision Review**: Reflecting on past rounds, consider
whether higher or lower contribution levels would have increased your earnings
based on group behavior. If you've contributed too much without reciprocated
cooperation, reducing future contributions might be wise. In summary, adjust
your strategy by initially testing the waters with moderate contributions and
then adapting based on the observed behaviors of your group members, emphasizing
selfish maximization without harming the group's potential growth too much.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Jackson Wright will likely start by considering his goal of maximizing his
personal earnings, while also being mindful of how group dynamics can affect
eventual payouts. 1. **Initial Analysis**: Given there are no reputational
repercussions due to the Basic condition of the game, Jackson may be inclined
towards a strategy that initially tests the group's response. This involves
observing whether group members are inclined towards cooperation or
self-interest. 2. **Starting Strategy**: To gather information and gauge the
group's cooperative tendencies, contributing a moderate amount such as $5.0
allows Jackson to balance between testing the waters and preserving his personal
funds. 3. **Observation and Adaptation**: After the first round, he can analyze
the group's behavior—if others also make moderate to high contributions, the
collective benefit could be sizable. If not, Jackson will have preserved half of
his initial allocation while understanding the group's tendency. 4. **Adjustment
for Future Rounds**: This initial strategy provides an opportunity to adapt in
future rounds based on observed behavior. If the group shows high contributions,
increasing his own in later rounds might maximize returns. Conversely, if the
group is non-cooperative, maintaining lower contributions might be more
beneficial. In conclusion, based on the initial round of this game, Jackson will
test group behavior while securing some personal earning. I choose to contribute
$5.0 to the group fund.

--- Character Assessment ---
Player_13, being Jackson Wright, is someone who tends to prioritize clear terms
and personal accountability, suggesting a balanced approach between personal
gain and group welfare. In economic games like the public goods game, Jackson
appreciates straightforward strategies and is likely focused on ensuring that
while personal payoff is maximized, contributions align with fair play and
mutual benefit, as demonstrated by his mid-level contribution in the first
round. This reflects a pragmatic approach that values both personal and
collective outcomes.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis ---
Based on what we know, Player_13 has limited information about the other
participants’ personalities or strategies since they are part of the Basic
condition, which excludes gossip or feedback. In Round 1, the contributions
varied, with an average of $5.5 per person. This suggests a cautious approach
balanced between cooperation and self-interest.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis 2 ---
Based on what we know, the other players in my group might perceive my previous
contribution of $5 as moderately cooperative. Since this amount was close to the
group average of $5.5, it signals a willingness to participate without
overcommitting. In the current context, maintaining or slightly increasing my
contribution could bolster mutual trust and potentially encourage others to
contribute similarly, ensuring better payouts for everyone involved. On the
other hand, if I decide to decrease my contribution, it might prompt others to
also become more self-interested in future rounds to protect their earnings.
Without gossip or ostracism, my actions are less likely to impact future groups
directly, but consistency and a slightly cooperative approach could positively
influence the group's dynamic.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_13 is participating in the second round of
a public goods game as part of Group_3, along with new participants Player_23,
Player_18, and Player_17. They are in the Basic condition, meaning there is no
mechanism for gossiping or ostracizing other players. Player_13 needs to decide
how much to contribute to the group fund, taking into account their previous
experience in Round 1, where they contributed $5 and the group averaged $5.5 per
person. This strategic decision involves balancing self-interest with
cooperation to maximize personal and group earnings.

--- Strategy Reflection ---
Based on what we know, the game involves maximizing individual earnings by
deciding how much to contribute to a group fund, which benefits everyone in the
group. Since Player_13 is in the Basic condition with no gossip or ostracism,
strategic contributions are crucial. In Round 1, Player_13 contributed $5 and
earned $16 in total. The average contribution was $5.5, which suggests that a
slightly higher contribution could align well with the group’s behavior and
potentially increase earnings. However, the key is to balance contributions to
maximize personal gains without overcontributing. For Round 2 and beyond, to
selfishly maximize earnings, Player_13 could consider: 1. Analyzing Group
Behavior: Since each round involves new players, early rounds should be used to
gauge average contributions. This approach can provide a benchmark for deciding
on contributions in subsequent rounds. 2. Adjusting Contributions: If the
average contributions are below the optimal cooperative level (where everyone's
contributions maximize the group fund's output effectively), maintaining or
slightly increasing the contribution aligns better with personal profit
maximization without risking unnecessary overcontribution that might not be
reciprocated. 3. Learning from Successful Players: High earners likely found a
sweet spot in contribution that optimizes personal income while maintaining a
balance with group dynamics. Observing if players tend to cluster around certain
contribution amounts can offer insights. In hindsight, contributing slightly
more than the average could have been beneficial if Player_13 noticed
inconsistencies or lower-than-expected group average contributions. For future
rounds, closely observe group behavior in the first few rounds to inform a
strategy that gradually escalates contributions if others follow suit, ensuring
personal profit is maximized given the dynamics.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Jackson Wright will first assess the behavior of new group members, recognizing
that previously, a mid-range contribution of $5 proved moderately cooperative
and aligned closely with the group's average. This suggests that Jackson values
both mutual benefit and personal gain. 1. Assess Group Dynamics: With new
players in Group_3, Jackson will consider that the previous round's average
contribution was $5.5. Without gossip or ostracism, he lacks direct feedback
about others' strategic preferences, emphasizing the importance of his own
contribution as a signal. 2. Contribution Strategy: Given the lack of punitive
measures and the game's economic incentives, Jackson may opt for a slightly
adjusted contribution to gauge others' reactions, possibly aiming for a moderate
increase to encourage cooperative behavior without heavily risking funds. 3.
Align with Group Average: Since his previous contribution closely matched the
average and earned him a reasonable return, he may adjust this slightly based on
intuition and new group observations. After considering these steps, Jackson
decides that aligning slightly above his previous contribution could promote
trust and collective contribution in Group_3. Thus, he chooses to contribute $6
to balance between self-interest and cooperative potential.

--- Observation ---
Recent context: 25 Mar 2025 [17:47:16 - 22:47:16]: Player_13 is participating in
a six-round economic game with 24 participants, where they are assigned to
different groups of four in each round to maximize their earnings. In the first

Player_13 contributed $5 and $6, respectively, in a Basic condition with no
gossip or ostracism, earning $16 and $12.2 from group funds, and is now in the
third round with new group members.

--- Character Assessment ---
Player_13, being Jackson Wright, is someone who values clear terms and strategic
decisions, likely aiming to maximize his own payoff. Given his background in
dealing with contracts and agreements, he understands the importance of
individual contributions but also recognizes opportunities to benefit personally
within the rules of the game. His contributions are strategic, balancing between
ensuring a reasonable group fund while optimizing his own earnings, which
suggests a primary focus on personal gain with some consideration for group
welfare to sustain mutual benefit.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis ---
Based on what we know, Player_13 has observed varying contribution behaviors
from the different players across the first two rounds. In Round 1,
contributions were relatively balanced, with Player_1 contributing the most at
$7 and others, including Player_13, contributing $5 each, leading to equitable
earnings. This suggests Player_1 might be slightly more cooperative or
risk-taking than others.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis 2 ---
Based on what we know, Player_13 might consider that their group members in the
current round might be influenced by the contribution patterns observed in the
previous rounds. If Player_13 chooses to contribute a moderate amount similar to
previous contributions, it could encourage a balanced contribution from others,
promoting fairness and reciprocity. On the other hand, a high contribution could
set a cooperative tone but might also incur personal financial risk if others
defect or contribute minimally. Conversely, a lower contribution might maximize
personal earnings but could risk negative perceptions from other players,
potentially influencing their future behavior towards reduced trust and
cooperation. Therefore, Player_13 might aim for a strategic contribution that
balances personal gain with collaborative engagement, depending on their read of
the new group members' likely reciprocity or tendency to free-ride.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_13 is about to participate in Round 3 of a
six-round public goods game, where they are in a new group with Player_2,
Player_19, and Player_17 (whom they recognize from Round 2). They're in a Basic
condition where no gossip or ostracism exists, meaning they must rely solely on
previous observations of others' behaviors and their strategies to decide how
much to contribute to the group fund. Player_13 must consider the previous round
behaviors of Player_17, who had the lowest contribution, alongside the unknown
tendencies of Player_2 and Player_19, to determine an optimal contribution
strategy that balances potential group earnings with personal gain, while also
considering the risk of others contributing minimally. The goal is to
potentially encourage cooperative behavior within the group while maximizing
individual earnings over the course of the game.

--- Strategy Reflection ---
Based on what we know, the goal is to maximize personal earnings in a game
setting where contributions to a group fund are beneficial, but self-interested
strategies can also prevail. In the first two rounds, Player_13 contributed $5
and $6, earning $16 and $12.2, respectively. The contributions of other players
varied, creating different outcomes for the group and influencing individual
earnings. Here's a step-by-step approach to maximizing earnings moving forward:
1. **Recognize Contribution Patterns**: Analyze the previous rounds—many players
tend to contribute less than the maximum ($10), likely aiming to balance between
immediate personal gain and group profit. Notice that despite different group
formations, few people contribute the full amount. 2. **Adjust Contributions
Appropriately**: Since there are no gossip or ostracism mechanisms in this game,
strategic selfishness has no social repercussions. Observing the averages from
the first two rounds, you might strategically lower your contributions slightly
to increase personal retention while still earning from the group fund. 3.
**React to Behavior Trends**: In Round 1, you earned more due to higher total
group contributions, so participating generously in balanced groups can be
advantageous. However, in Round 2, a sharply lower contribution still resulted
in decent earnings, suggesting flexibility. 4. **Predict Group Dynamics**:
Players may continue to contribute less as rounds progress since there's no
threat of reprisal, leading to increased personal cash retention. Acknowledge
this trend and incrementally decrease your contribution to maximize
self-benefit, provided contributions remain sufficient for earning from the
group fund. 5. **Reflect on Past Choices**: The initial contributions in Rounds
1 and 2 were moderate; while not maximizing immediate private gain, they weren't
excessively generous either. In future rounds, it's beneficial to experiment
with less cooperative contributions to increase personal end-round sums—focused
experimentation can help refine this tactic. 6. **Strategic Contribution
Management**: In future rounds, contribute just enough to earn meaningful
returns from the group fund, assessing the balance between contributing less and
still benefiting from others’ higher contributions. Push the contribution pencil
towards minimal yet passive gainful positions. Overall, as rounds proceed with
no gossip or ostracism consequences, adopting a strategy that minimizes
contribution while still securing returns from the shared fund can be effective
in this condition, learning actively from rounds and dynamically adjusting the
approach.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Jackson Wright will evaluate the strategic landscape of the current round based
on his experiences from the first two rounds. Here's how he might approach the
decision step-by-step: 1. **Review Past Rounds**: In the first round, a
contribution of $5 balanced with the group led to considerable earnings, while
in the second round, a higher contribution of $6 in a less cooperative group
resulted in lower returns. This indicates that group dynamics significantly
affect outcomes. 2. **Assess Current Group**: Considering that Player_17 is
repeating in the group with Player_13 for the second time, Jackson might
anticipate their behavior based on the previous round where Player_17
contributed only $2.5. This low contribution behavior might discourage higher
contributions. 3. **Strategic Adjustment**: With these observations, Jackson
could deduce that contributing moderately, around $4 or $5, might minimize
personal risk while still encouraging a functional group contribution outcome.
4. **Personal Profit Maximization**: As there's no risk of social repercussion
in this Basic condition, lowering contributions marginally compared to earlier
rounds could maintain decent returns while optimizing personal retention. 5.
**Balance Cooperation and Self-interest**: Jackson is likely to choose a careful
balance that leans slightly towards personal gain, with the understanding that
others might adopt a similar strategy of contributing less. Taking this
methodical approach into account, Jackson Wright might conclude: I choose to
contribute $4 to the group fund.

--- Character Assessment ---
Player_13, being Jackson Wright, is someone who would likely focus on maximizing
his own payoff in the economic game. His background as a construction
contractor, dealing with clear terms and agreements, suggests he values direct
benefits and ensures personal gain. His actions in the game so far indicate a
pattern of adjusting contributions based on group behavior, likely to secure the
best individual outcome. Jackson seems to weigh the potential personal gains
carefully, contributing just enough to maintain fairness while optimizing his
own earnings.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis ---
Based on what we know, Player_13 has encountered varying levels of contribution
from other players, indicating differing strategies and priorities.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis 2 ---
Based on what we know, the other players in your group may respond to your
decisions in several ways, depending on their individual strategies and
perceptions of fairness. If you contribute significantly more than the average,
they might view you as cooperative and might be encouraged to increase their
contributions in future rounds to align with your behavior. Conversely, if you
contribute less than the average, they may perceive you as less cooperative,
potentially prompting them to reduce their own contributions since there's no
pressure from gossip or ostracism. Your next decision could either enhance
cooperation if you increase your contribution or lead to more cautious and
self-serving behaviors from others if you decide to contribute less.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_13 is in the fourth round of a public goods
game, participating as part of Group_6 alongside Player_9, Player_16, and
Player_7. In this round, as in previous ones, they face the challenge of
deciding how much to contribute to the group fund with the aim of maximizing
personal earnings while navigating the varying contribution levels from other
players. Player_13 must weigh the lack of gossip or ostracism as potential
motivating factors, focusing instead on strategies that might encourage
cooperative behavior without these external pressures.

--- Strategy Reflection ---
Based on what we know, Player_13 should focus on maximizing their personal
earnings by strategically adjusting their contributions in response to the
behaviors observed in their groups. In this public goods game condition, there
is no gossip or ostracism, which means decisions are entirely based on
individual strategy rather than social consequences. 1. **Observations and
Strategy:** - **Round 1:** Player_13 contributed $5.0, resulting in earnings of
$16.0. The average group contribution was slightly higher at $5.5. - **Round
2:** Player_13 increased their contribution to $6.0, yet their earnings
decreased to $12.2 as the group contribution average was lower at $4.1. -
**Round 3:** Lowering their contribution to $4.0, Player_13's earnings were
$11.0, which was consistent given the group’s lower average contribution of
$2.5. 2. **Selfish Strategy Analysis:** - Players who kept more of their money
(like in Round 3) earned comparatively more as the group contributions
decreased. For instance, keeping more funds and contributing less correlated
with higher personal earnings for others. - Adjust future contributions based on
group behavior: Each player kept more for themselves after seeing others
contribute less. Follow suit by contributing less if others are doing so but
increase slightly if the group tends toward higher contributions to capitalize
on the group earnings without over-contributing individually. 3. **Future
Adjustments:** - To maximize earnings selfishly moving forward: - **Observe
Group Dynamics:** Pay attention to the contributions in early rounds of each
group you join. If they are consistently low, decrease your contributions
accordingly. - **Test Contributions:** Experiment with slightly higher
contributions in early rounds to test group cooperation. If reciprocity is
lacking, revert to minimal contributions in subsequent rounds. - **Learn from
Success:** In earlier rounds, successful players contributed minimally and kept
more funds, indicating a potential benefit to lowering contributions unless the
group shows more cooperative behavior. By maintaining a flexible strategy that
responds to observed group behaviors while prioritizing personal fund retention,
Player_13 can maximize their long-term earnings. In past rounds, potentially
lowering contributions earlier could have increased earnings, suggesting a
swifter adaptation to the contribution patterns of other players in future
rounds.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Jackson Wright will first consider his previous rounds’ outcomes, noting the
differing strategies of his group members. Observing that higher personal
retention typically leads to greater individual earnings in groups with lower
average contributions, he will aim to contribute minimally while benefiting from
the group fund. Given previous rounds’ dynamics, he will account for the fact
that other players tended to decrease contributions in the absence of
accountability mechanisms like gossip or ostracism. Jackson will then evaluate
the contribution trends of the new group, expecting similar behavior based on
earlier rounds. To maximize his own earnings while testing the group’s
willingness to cooperate, he might strategically opt for a conservative
contribution to gauge the collective response. Considering these factors: I
choose to contribute $2.0 to the group fund.

Player_13 chooses to contribute $1.0 to the group fund.

=== COMPONENT BREAKDOWN ===

--- Observation ---
Recent context: 25 Mar 2025 [18:07:16 - 23:07:16]: Player_13 is participating in
an economic game involving six rounds, aiming to maximize earnings by
contributing to a group fund in a setup that rotates group members and
conditions forbidding gossip or ostracism. Across the rounds, Player_13's
contributions and strategies vary, with earnings fluctuating based on individual
and group contributions.

group fund in a setup that rotates group members and conditions forbidding
gossip or ostracism. Across the rounds, Player_13's contributions and strategies
vary, with earnings fluctuating based on individual and group contributions.

--- Character Assessment ---
Player_13, being Jackson Wright, is someone who approaches economic games with a
pragmatic and self-interested mindset. Given his experience with contracts and
agreements, Jackson likely prioritizes his own payoff over maximizing group
welfare. His actions in the game demonstrate a direct approach, carefully
balancing contributions to ensure personal benefit without fully disadvantaging
others, reflecting his no-nonsense personality.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis ---
Based on what we know, the players seem to exhibit varying strategies possibly
indicating different approaches to risk and maximizing personal gain.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis 2 ---
Based on what we know, the other players in your group may perceive your
decisions according to the pattern of contributions exhibited so far. In the
Basic condition, where gossip and ostracism are not possible, reactions are
largely shaped by observed strategies and outcomes. If you've been contributing
more consistently than others, some players might expect you to continue this
pattern, potentially allowing them to free-ride on your generosity. Conversely,
if your contributions decrease, they may feel compelled to contribute more
themselves in future rounds to maintain their earnings. Moreover, if your next
decision involves reducing your contribution, it could signal to others that
aligning their strategy with yours could maximize their individual earnings.
Ultimately, the choices you make not only influence your immediate earnings but
also set a tone for the collaborative dynamics in upcoming rounds.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_13 is in the fifth round of a six-round
public goods game and is part of Group_5 alongside Player_3, Player_1, and
Player_4. The Basic condition of the game means there is no possibility for
gossip or ostracism, which affects how players perceive each other's strategies.
Player_13 must decide on their contribution to the group fund, aiming to balance
personal gain against the contributions of the other group members. Previous
rounds have shown varying contribution strategies from different players, and
Player_13's decision may influence the behavior of others, either encouraging
free-riding or prompting higher contributions based on observed patterns.

--- Strategy Reflection ---
Based on what we know, the optimal strategy for maximizing personal earnings in
this public goods game, given the Basic condition with no gossip or ostracism,
involves a careful assessment of prior rounds and player behavior. In the
initial rounds, if other players contribute generously, the group fund grows,
increasing everyone's potential returns. However, you've observed a decline in
contributions over time, suggesting players are leaning towards selfish behavior
to maximize personal holdings. 1. **Round-by-Round Analysis**: Initially, you
contributed a substantial amount ($6.0 in Round 2) when the average contribution
was higher. Your earnings were then relatively balanced between personal
retention and group fund returns. However, subsequent rounds saw diminishing
group contributions. In Round 3, you contributed less ($4.0) but still more than
others. By Round 4, your contribution decreased further to $2.0 as the average
contribution dropped drastically, indicating a strategic pivot to align with the
group's behavior. 2. **Adjusting Strategy**: Moving forward, particularly in the
final rounds (Rounds 5 and 6), it may be advantageous to mirror the observed
trends of decreasing contributions. This aligns short-term individual gain with
the game environment since maximizing individual retention becomes more
lucrative when others also pull back funds. 3. **Observations from Successful
Players**: Players who retained more (e.g., in Round 4, Player_16 retained $10.0
with zero contribution) secured higher personal earnings when group
contributions were low. Learning from this, reducing your contribution or
matching the lowest contributor can safeguard personal earnings without heavily
relying on the group fund, especially since notice has shown perceptions of
trust or cooperation are not enforced due to condition rules. 4. **Future
Decision-Making**: Future opportunities could involve analyzing group dynamics
shortly before each round's decision. If you observe similar low contributions,
the strategy should lean further towards minimal group contributions combined
with maximizing what you retain, ensuring that any added funds from the group
are perceived as a bonus rather than a core part of earnings. This way, personal
earnings remain higher irrespective of the group's total fund. By utilizing
these observations and strategic adjustments, your approach to subsequent rounds
should increasingly safeguard your personal earnings in this public goods game
setup.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Jackson Wright will analyze previous rounds and consider the strategies of his
group mates. In previous rounds, when the average contribution decreased,
Jackson aligned his contributions accordingly. In Round 4, he contributed only
$2.0 to mirror the trend of decreasing contributions. Given that this is Round
5, and based on the observed pattern of dropping contributions to maximize
personal retention, Jackson is likely to continue this strategy. He will
consider the fact that in Round 4, players who contributed less secured higher
personal earnings. Jackson understands that in the current Basic condition,
where there are no consequences for low contributions, minimizing his
contribution maximizes his retained earnings. Additionally, Jackson will take
into account that if other players continue contributing minimally, maintaining
a low contribution aligns his strategy with preserving personal earnings.
Therefore, Jackson would likely choose to contribute a minimal amount, in line
with the observed behaviors of his fellow players. Since contributing a minimal
amount has aligned with maximizing his personal gains thus far, he decides to
contribute conservatively. I choose to contribute $2.0 to the group fund.


[OBSERVATION 2025-03-25 21:29:59] Round 5 Results: Total group contribution: $9.0; Your contribution: $1.0, Your earnings: $13.5 ($9.0 kept + $4.5 from group fund); Player_3 contribution: $2.5, earnings: $12.0 ($7.5 kept + $4.5 from group fund); Player_1 contribution: $3.0, earnings: $11.5 ($7.0 kept + $4.5 from group fund); Player_4 contribution: $2.5, earnings: $12.0 ($7.5 kept + $4.5 from group fund); Average contribution per group member: $2.2; Average earnings per group member: $12.2

--- Observation ---
Recent context: 25 Mar 2025 [18:12:16 - 23:12:16]: Player_13 participated in an
economic game with 24 players, divided into different groups for each of the six
rounds they played. In the Basic condition with no gossip or ostracism,
Player_13 varied their contributions each round, with earnings reflecting both
personal and group strategies, culminating in a diverse set of outcomes across
rounds.

--- Character Assessment ---
Player_13, being Jackson Wright, is someone who likely prioritizes his own
payoff over maximizing group welfare. Given his professional background in
dealing with contracts and his direct, no-nonsense personality, Jackson probably
values clear outcomes and efficiency, leading him to focus on strategies that
ensure his individual gain, as seen by his contributions aimed at maintaining a
balance between group cooperation and personal benefit.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis ---
Based on what we know, the behavior of the participants in the public goods game
shows varying levels of cooperation and self-interest, which can provide
insights into their personalities and likely strategies.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis 2 ---
Based on what we know, the other players might view Player_13's decisions
through the lens of reciprocity and adaptation. Given that Player_13's
contributions varied from round to round, other players may perceive this as
strategic flexibility. If Player_13 continues to contribute minimally compared
to others, players might feel incentivized to also lower their contributions to
maximize personal gain. Conversely, if Player_13 increases their contribution
significantly, it might encourage others to reciprocate with higher
contributions, promoting a more cooperative environment in the last round.
Consequently, Player_13's next decision could either foster trust and
collaboration or reinforce competition and individualism, depending on the
perceived intent and alignment with group norms.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_13 is in the final round of the public
goods game, specifically Round 6 out of 6. They are part of Group_5 alongside
Player_11, Player_21, and Player_20. In this Basic condition, there is no gossip
or ostracism, meaning information about past contributions isn’t shared among
players. Player_13 needs to decide on their contribution level for this round,
weighing the benefits of personal gain against promoting group cooperation.
Their decision will impact not only their own earnings but also how others in
the group might respond, which could foster either collaboration or individual
competition.

--- Strategy Reflection ---
Based on what we know, the best strategy to selfishly maximize your long-term
earnings in this public goods game would be to minimize your contributions while
still benefiting from the group's overall contribution. In the Basic condition,
where there is no gossip or ostracism, you can focus on keeping as much of your
own funds as possible, because there are no social repercussions for
contributing less. Here’s a step-by-step thought process: 1. **Observe Past
Contributions**: In previous rounds, players contributing less than the average
managed to earn decent amounts because they retained more of their personal
funds. For example, in Round 4, Player_16 contributed $0.0 and still earned
$12.0, which was higher than others who contributed. 2. **Adjust Strategy Based
on Group**: Your contribution should be strategic. If in a particular round you
notice others are contributing highly, you might slightly increase your own
contribution to maintain good returns from the group fund. However, in general,
aim to contribute less than the average. 3. **End-game Strategy**: As you
approach the final rounds, it is beneficial to minimize your contributions
significantly, as long-term cooperation isn't necessary beyond the game. In
other words, take advantage of the final round to maximize your personal
retention. 4. **Learn from High Earners**: Observing the players who earned the
most in prior rounds, they generally balanced a mix of low contributions with
consistent returns from the group fund. 5. **Future Adjustments**: In past
rounds, if you contributed more than needed, adjust by lowering your
contributions in future rounds unless a strategic reason exists to do
differently. By focusing your strategy on retaining as much of your own funds
while still benefiting from others' contributions, you maximize earnings in this
non-punitive setup. Adapt dynamically based on how the group's overall
contribution trend appears each round.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Jackson Wright will evaluate his past rounds and aim to find the sweet spot
between self-interest and group benefit without compromising his own earnings.
1. **Review Past Contributions**: In previous rounds, his strategy has involved
contributing strategically while allowing for substantial personal gain. For
instance, contributing less than others enabled higher personal retention, as
seen in earlier rounds where others benefited from his contribution but he
retained more funds by contributing less. 2. **Consider Group Behavior**:
Observing other players, those who contributed below average often earned well
due to keeping more funds for themselves. 3. **Maximize Personal Gain**: Given
there are no repercussions for low contributions in the Basic condition, Jackson
is inclined to prioritize his own earnings. 4. **Evaluate End-game Strategy**:
With it being the final round, long-term cooperation isn't essential. Thus,
conserving personal funds is a rational choice. Considering these factors,
Jackson decides on a strategy aligning with maximizing individual profit while
minimally engaging with the group fund. I choose to contribute $1.0 to the group
fund.
