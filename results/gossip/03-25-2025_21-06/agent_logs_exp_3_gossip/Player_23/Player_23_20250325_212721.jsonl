So far, Player_23 has contributed $5 in the first two rounds, aligning with the average group contribution and earning $14 each time. The player has also chosen to send positive notes about their group members, emphasizing cooperation and fairness. Now, in Round 2, there is a slight variation in contributions, with some players, like Player_22, reducing their contributions slightly.
