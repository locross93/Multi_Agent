Fostering a reputation for moderate cooperation can yield trust and consistent inclusion in high-yield rounds.", "", "6. **Retrospective Adjustments**: Reflecting on past decisions, such as contribution amounts relative to group averages, suggests scope for slightly increasing contributions when cooperation is high.
