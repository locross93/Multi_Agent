[OBSERVATION 2025-03-25 21:07:13] You are participating in an economic game with 24 participants.
        Your goal is to maximize your earnings in the game.
        
        Everyone will be randomly assigned to groups of 4 for each round. You will play a total of 6 rounds, and 
        in each round you will be in a different group with people you haven't played with before.
        
        In each round, all players receive $10. Each player can contribute any amount between $0 and $10 to a group fund.
        Any amount contributed to the group fund will be multiplied by 2 and divided equally among all 4 group members.
        Any amount not contributed stays in your private account.
        
        For example, if everyone contributes $10, the group fund becomes $40, which is multiplied to $80, and each person 
        receives $20 (a $10 profit). However, if you contribute nothing while everyone else contributes $10, the group fund
        becomes $30, which is multiplied to $60, and each person receives $15. So you would have $25 total ($10 kept + $15 from group).
        
        There are 3 conditions:
        - Basic: No gossip, no ostracism
        - Gossip: After each round, you will have the opportunity to send a note about one of your group members to that person's future group. Remember you will be with a different group of people in the next round. Before each round, you will see any notes sent about your upcoming group members.
        - Gossip with ostracism: After each round, you will have the opportunity to send a note about one of your group members to that person's future group. Before each round, you will see any notes sent about your upcoming group members, and you can vote to exclude one person from your group. If you are excluded from a group, you will not be able to participate in the next round and will earn $0 for that round.
        You are in the Basic condition, which means that there is no gossip or ostracism.
[OBSERVATION 2025-03-25 21:07:16] You are in Round 1/6: You are in Group_6 with Player_9, Player_22, Player_21.

--- Observation ---
Recent context: 25 Mar 2025 [17:07:01 - 22:07:01]: Player_11 is participating in
an economic game with 24 participants, aiming to maximize earnings over 6
rounds. In each round, players are assigned to different groups, and Player_11
currently belongs to Group_6 with Player_9, Player_22, and Player_21 in the
Basic condition, which does not allow for gossip or ostracism.

--- Recent context ---
25 Mar 2025 [17:07:01 - 22:07:01]: Player_11 is participating in an economic
game with 24 participants, aiming to maximize earnings over 6 rounds. In each
round, players are assigned to different groups, and Player_11 currently belongs
to Group_6 with Player_9, Player_22, and Player_21 in the Basic condition, which
does not allow for gossip or ostracism.

--- Character Assessment ---
Player_11, being Leo Virtanen, is someone who likely prioritizes finding a
balance between maximizing both group welfare and his own payoff. As a
professional mediator who specializes in resolving complex disputes and seeks
win-win solutions, Leo would emphasize cooperation and mutual benefit,
recognizing that fostering trust and collaboration can lead to better outcomes
for everyone involved, including himself.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis ---
Based on what we know, Player_11 does not have any specific information about
the personalities or past behaviors of the other players in Group_6 since this
is the first round and they are in the Basic condition, which doesn’t allow for
sharing personal feedback or gossip among players. However, generally speaking,
players might initially exhibit cooperative behavior, such as contributing their
full $10 to the group fund, to maximize the total group earnings and test the
waters for mutual cooperation.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis 2 ---
Based on what we know, the other players in Group_6 might initially assume a
level of trust and cooperation, especially since this is the first round. If
Player_11 decides to contribute the full $10 in this round, it could foster a
sense of mutual collaboration, encouraging other players to contribute fully as
well to maximize everyone's earnings. Alternatively, if Player_11 contributes
less, while others contribute more, it might create a sense of mistrust or
disappointment among the group members, although no direct feedback or negative
repercussions would occur due to the Basic condition. This first round sets the
tone for potential cooperation or cautious behavior in future rounds, even
though directly influencing others through gossip or ostracism isn’t an option.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_11 is participating in the first round of a
public goods game within the Basic condition, where they are grouped with
Player_9, Player_22, and Player_21. In this round, Player_11 must decide how
much of their $10 to contribute to the group fund, knowing that any
contributions will be doubled and shared among the group. However, there is no
mechanism for gossip or ostracism, meaning their decision cannot affect their
reputation among future group members. This setup requires Player_11 to consider
whether to trust that others will contribute fully to maximize collective
earnings or to attempt a strategy of contributing less while benefiting from
others' potential full contributions.

--- Strategy Reflection ---
Based on what we know, the optimal strategy to maximize personal earnings in
this economic game involves carefully balancing individual contributions to the
group fund. In the Basic condition, without the option of gossip or ostracism,
players' past actions don't directly impact future rounds because there's no
mechanism to relay behaviors across groups. In Round 1, you should consider
testing the waters by contributing a moderate amount, such as $5, to observe
others' behaviors and responses. This approach minimizes risk, as you're still
keeping half of your initial allocation while benefiting from any group
contributions. As the rounds progress, pay attention to patterns in group
contributions. If a trend shows that others consistently contribute high amounts
to the fund, consider slightly increasing your contribution in later rounds to
ensure you're not perceived as free-riding, which might lead any savvy players
to reduce their own contributions, eventually harming overall earnings. Since
it's all about maximizing your own earnings without repercussions from other
participants due to the Basic condition, you might choose to contribute less in
earlier rounds if others are contributing significantly, maximizing immediate
personal gain. As you approach the final rounds, if you notice people tend to
mimic others' contributions from previous rounds, aligning your strategy with
this pattern could be beneficial. Reflecting on previous rounds, if there were
opportunities to contribute less while reaping higher returns due to others'
high contributions, adjusting future contributions lower could optimize
earnings. Always be responsive to group dynamics and ready to adapt your
contributions based on the observed behavior within your groups. This
adaptability is key for maximum earnings while maintaining a low risk of
individual loss in each round.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Leo Virtanen will consider several factors before making his decision. As a
professional mediator, he understands the importance of cooperation and mutual
benefit. In the Basic condition, there are no direct consequences for individual
contribution choices, such as exclusion or gossip. This allows him to take a
calculated risk.


[OBSERVATION 2025-03-25 21:07:52] Round 1 Results: Total group contribution: $13.0; Your contribution: $5.0, Your earnings: $11.5 ($5.0 kept + $6.5 from group fund); Player_9 contribution: $0.0, earnings: $16.5 ($10.0 kept + $6.5 from group fund); Player_22 contribution: $5.0, earnings: $11.5 ($5.0 kept + $6.5 from group fund); Player_21 contribution: $3.0, earnings: $13.5 ($7.0 kept + $6.5 from group fund); Average contribution per group member: $3.2; Average earnings per group member: $13.2

Recent context: 25 Mar 2025 [17:17:01 - 22:17:01]: Player_11 is participating in
an economic game involving 24 participants and is in the Basic condition, which

$11.5, and is now entering Round 2 in a new group configuration.

--- Character Assessment ---
Player_11, being Leo Virtanen, is someone who likely strives to balance both
personal earnings and the group's overall welfare. Given his background as a
professional mediator who seeks win-win solutions and values insight, he would
aim to contribute fairly in economic games, encouraging cooperation among
participants. His approach in the public goods game would typically involve
contributing a reasonable amount to the group fund to enhance collective
benefits while also ensuring a satisfactory personal payoff. This balanced
approach reflects his interest in fostering cooperative dynamics and maximizing
mutual gains over purely individualistic strategies.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis ---
Based on what we know, Player_9 seems to be opting for a more self-interested
strategy, contributing nothing in Round 1 and maximizing their earnings to
$16.5. This behavior suggests a likelihood of free-riding in future rounds as
well, assuming other group members continue contributing. Player_22, like
Player_11, made a moderate contribution of $5, which could indicate an
inclination towards reciprocal cooperation, expecting others to contribute
similarly. Player_21 contributed $3, showing a slightly less cooperative stance
but still participating in the group effort.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis 2 ---
Based on what we know, the other players in my group might have different
reactions based on their tendencies shown in previous rounds. Player_17 and
Player_13 are new to me, but given Player_9's past behavior of contributing
nothing and maximizing personal gain, they might expect me to lower my
contribution to protect my own interests. However, if I decide to maintain or
slightly increase my contribution, like $7, it could encourage players like
Player_17 and Player_13 to contribute more themselves, assuming they tend
towards reciprocal cooperation. Conversely, if I follow Player_9's lead and
contribute nothing, it might lead to a breakdown in group cooperation,
potentially pushing the group towards a non-cooperative equilibrium where
everyone keeps their $10. My decisions in this round could influence whether the
new group perceives me as cooperative or self-interested, impacting their
willingness to contribute in subsequent rounds.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_11 is now entering Round 2 of a public
goods game in the Basic condition, which does not allow gossip or ostracism. In
this round, Player_11 is grouped with new participants: Player_17, Player_9 (who
previously contributed nothing in Round 1), and Player_13. Player_11 needs to
decide how much to contribute to the group fund, taking into account the
free-riding behavior exhibited by Player_9 in the previous round and attempting
to predict the behaviors of the other new group members. The decision will need
to balance between contributing enough to encourage reciprocal cooperation and
protecting personal earnings if others do not contribute.

--- Strategy Reflection ---
Based on what we know, the best strategy for maximizing long-term earnings in
this public goods game involves balancing contribution and retention. In the
Basic condition, you don't have to worry about being ostracized or having your
reputation affected by gossip. In Round 1, you contributed $5 and received
$11.5, while Player_9 contributed nothing and received $16.5. This indicates a
potential strategy to maximize earnings is to minimize your contribution while
benefiting from the contributions of others. Given this, as rounds progress, you
should consider contributing less than the average to preserve more of your
initial $10. Observe patterns in your group members' behaviors: if they tend to
contribute consistently low amounts, matching their behavior could be optimal.
If individuals are highly cooperative, preventing free-riding might protect your
returns. Reflecting on past decisions, contributing $5 was more than necessary,
given Player_9's success with no contribution. Adapting this insight could
increase your total earnings. In future rounds, experiment with contributions
closer to $0 or a moderately low amount, monitoring how your earning dynamics
adjust. This approach, focused on selfish maximization within the game's
framework, aligns with the observed behaviors leading to higher earnings without
negative social repercussions in this condition.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Leo Virtanen will start by considering his experiences from Round 1 and the
observed behaviors of his fellow participants. In the first round, by
contributing $5, he observed that Player_9 contributed nothing yet received the
highest earnings. This suggests a potential incentive for low contributions.
However, Leo, as a professional mediator, values fostering cooperative
environments and might want to encourage contributions, hoping others will
reciprocate. First, Leo recognizes that with no gossip or ostracism, there's
more room for strategic contribution choices without worry about future rounds
affecting his reputation. Seeing the pattern, he understands contributing a
smaller amount might protect his own earnings. Despite this, his inclination
towards fair play nudges him to maintain a somewhat balanced contribution to
sustain the cooperative spirit. Given his analysis, Leo contemplates the
potential risk of reduced group cooperation if he contributes nothing. If all
members decide not to contribute, the group's collective earnings could dwindle.
Thus, while minimizing contribution is a viable strategy, a token amount that
balances personal gain and group benefits seems reasonable. After weighing these
considerations, Leo decides on a strategy intended to signal willingness to
cooperate while still being cautious of free riders like Player_9. I choose to
contribute $3 to the group fund.


[OBSERVATION 2025-03-25 21:08:29] Round 2 Results: Total group contribution: $9.0; Your contribution: $3.0, Your earnings: $11.5 ($7.0 kept + $4.5 from group fund); Player_17 contribution: $4.0, earnings: $10.5 ($6.0 kept + $4.5 from group fund); Player_9 contribution: $0.0, earnings: $14.5 ($10.0 kept + $4.5 from group fund); Player_13 contribution: $2.0, earnings: $12.5 ($8.0 kept + $4.5 from group fund); Average contribution per group member: $2.2; Average earnings per group member: $12.2

--- Character Assessment ---
Player_11, being Leo Virtanen, is someone who likely seeks a balance between
maximizing group welfare and his own payoff. Given his background as a
professional mediator who specializes in resolving disputes and finding win-win
solutions, it would be in character for him to contribute to the group fund in a
way that promotes cooperation and collective benefit, while also keeping an eye
on his personal earnings. This balanced approach is reflected in how he has
contributed moderate amounts in the past rounds, likely aiming to encourage
others to cooperate while safeguarding his individual interests.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis ---
Based on what we know, Player_9 seems to consistently contribute nothing to the
group fund, suggesting a strategy that leans towards maximizing personal
earnings by relying on others' contributions. This indicates they may continue
with a free-riding approach unless they perceive a shift in others' strategies.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis 2 ---
Based on what we know, the other players might start to adjust their
contributions depending on the patterns they observe. For instance, noticing
Player_9's tendency not to contribute might lead others to decrease their own
contributions to avoid being exploited. If I, as Player_11, decide to lower my
contribution in the next round, it could signal to the others that I am adapting
to protect my own earnings. This might encourage them to contribute less in
future rounds, potentially leading to a cycle where overall contributions
decrease, affecting the group's total earnings. However, if I decide to increase
my contribution, it could prompt a more cooperative response from the others, as
they might see it as a commitment to the group's success.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_11 is participating in an economic game
where they are grouped with different players in each round to contribute to a
group fund. They are currently in Round 3 and note that contributions impact
both personal and group earnings. In previous rounds, Player_11 observed that
Player_9 consistently contributed nothing, suggesting a free-rider approach.
This behavior could influence Player_11's strategy in deciding their
contribution amount, balancing between personal gain and group benefit. Since
they are in the Basic condition, there is no mechanism to communicate this
pattern to future groups or exclude non-contributors, making strategic
adaptation crucial to maximizing earnings.

--- Strategy Reflection ---
Based on what we know, the best strategy to maximize long-term earnings in the
public goods game is to contribute less than the maximum amount, especially
since it's clear that some players, like Player_9, are contributing $0
consistently. Since you are in the Basic condition with no gossip or ostracism,
you don't have to worry about reputational repercussions, allowing you to adjust
your strategy purely for personal gain. 1. **Observation from Rounds 1 and 2**:
Players who contributed less tended to have higher earnings because they
retained more money in their private account. For example, in both rounds, by
contributing less or none at all, Player_9 consistently maximized their
earnings. 2. **Adjusting Strategy**: Given no consequences for low
contributions, it would be strategic to reduce your contributions further in
future rounds. While in the first round you contributed $5 and in the second $3,
a lower or zero contribution could increase your private retention while still
benefiting from any group contributions. 3. **Successful Player Behavior**:
Emulating Player_9's strategy could be beneficial. With no negative outcomes for
low contributions in the current format, focusing on retaining as much of the
initial $10 as possible seems advantageous. 4. **Future Decisions**: In
subsequent rounds, consider contributing closer to $0 if other group members
appear to be contributing more, allowing you to capitalize on their input
without reducing your own holdings significantly. Evaluate each situation round
by round, assessing the group dynamics and total contributions to adjust your
strategy as needed. By lowering your contributions, you can potentially increase
your earnings as others may still contribute enough to ensure you receive some
benefit from the group fund, optimizing your personal earnings without added
risk.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Leo Virtanen will consider the previous rounds and his background as a mediator
when deciding how much to contribute. In the first round, contributing $5
allowed him to encourage cooperation but resulted in slightly lower earnings
than Player_9, who contributed nothing. In the second round, Leo reduced his
contribution to $3, still maintaining a cautious approach to encourage some
group cooperation while safeguarding personal earnings.

--- Character Assessment ---
Player_11, being Leo Virtanen, is someone who likely strives to find a balance
between maximizing personal payoff and considering the welfare of the group. As
a professional mediator who specializes in resolving complex disputes, Leo is
likely to value cooperation and fair strategies. His past actions in the game
show a willingness to contribute a moderate amount to the group fund, suggesting
he is mindful of both his earnings and the potential benefits of collaboration.
This approach aligns with his personality traits of being insightful and seeking
win-win solutions.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis ---
Based on what we know, Player_9 tends to consistently contribute nothing to the
group fund, suggesting a strategy focused on maximizing their individual
earnings by relying on others' contributions. This behavior might indicate a
willingness to free-ride, taking advantage of the group's efforts without
contributing. It's unlikely that Player_9 will change this strategy in future
rounds unless they observe a significant increase in contributions from others
or if there's an unexpected shift in group dynamics.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis 2 ---
Based on what we know, the other players might view my contributions as
relatively fair but potentially decreasing over time, given the observed
pattern. As we continue with the game, some players might choose to follow
Player_9's example and reduce their contributions to maximize individual
earnings, especially if they perceive others are contributing less. If I decide
to increase my contribution in the next rounds, it might encourage some players
to do the same, fostering a more collaborative atmosphere. Conversely, if I
lower my contributions like Player_9, it might lead to a further decrease in
overall contributions, as other players might adopt a similar strategy to
protect their earnings. To influence positive behavior, signaling a consistent
or slightly increased contribution can set a norm for cooperation in the group.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_11 is participating in a public goods game
where each round involves different group compositions, and the challenge lies
in deciding how much to contribute to a group fund to maximize personal
earnings. So far, Player_11 has observed varying contribution levels among group
members, with Player_9 notably contributing nothing in every round. This creates
a dilemma of whether to keep contributing fairly or reducing their contribution
to protect personal earnings, especially since other players might follow
Player_9's example and decrease their own contributions. Player_11 needs to
decide on a strategy that balances cooperation with self-interest, as each
player's strategy influences group dynamics and potential earnings.

--- Strategy Reflection ---
Based on what we know, the best strategy to maximize long-term earnings in the
public goods game involves adjusting my contributions based on the behavior of
other players. Since there is no gossip or ostracism, the risk of social
penalties for low contributions is minimized. Observations show that players
like Player_9, who contributed nothing in earlier rounds, earned more by keeping
all their initial endowment while still gaining from group funds. Therefore,
contributing less may increase my retained earnings while still receiving some
benefit from the group fund. For past decisions, I could have contributed less,
mimicking the strategy of low contributors who maintained higher personal
earnings. Going forward, I should aim to contribute the minimum required or
strategically reduce my contributions, especially if others continue to
contribute minimally. This approach aligns with maximizing personal gains when
cooperation isn't enforced or monitored.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Leo Virtanen will consider the following factors step by step: 1. Previous
Observations: In earlier rounds, higher contributions did not significantly
increase earnings. Leo observed that contributing less led to personal gain due
to the multiplication and division mechanism of the group fund. 2. Player
Dynamics: Player_9 consistently contributes nothing and still benefits from the
group fund. This free-riding behavior suggests that others might follow suit or
maintain low contributions, indicating a trend toward minimal contributions. 3.
Goal Alignment: As a mediator, Leo values cooperation but also aims to maximize
his earnings. Given no social penalties for low contributions, he can afford to
be more strategic in allocating funds. 4. Impact Analysis: Contributing a higher
amount in this environment might not incentivize others to do the same,
especially when there is no gossip or ostracism to encourage group cohesion or
higher contributions. 5. Earnings Optimization: To maximize his personal
earnings while still receiving some benefit from the group fund, Leo should
contribute minimally. This allows him to retain more of his initial endowment
while still partaking in the multiplied group fund.

have varied from $1 to $5 per round, with earnings dependent on contributions

adjustments as the rounds progress.

--- Character Assessment ---
Player_11, being Leo Virtanen, is someone who values collaboration and seeks
solutions that benefit everyone involved. However, based on the contributions in
this game, it appears there's a focus on balancing both personal gain and group
welfare. Leo seems to contribute strategically, making moderate contributions to
the group fund in early rounds to gauge group dynamics and perhaps test
cooperative tendencies of other players. This way, Leo might prioritize higher
individual earnings when contributions and trust levels among group members are
uncertain, yet staying open to increasing cooperation when others show similar
intentions.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis ---
Based on what we know, the players in the game appear to exhibit varying levels
of cooperativeness and strategic thinking.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis 2 ---
Based on what we know, Player_18, Player_21, and Player_24 will likely consider
both the overall contribution trend from previous rounds and the absence of
gossip or ostracism in the game. Without the ability to gossip or ostracize,
players might focus more on adjusting their strategies to maximize personal
earnings while contributing just enough to incentivize group cooperation. If you
increase your contribution, it might encourage others to do the same for mutual
benefit. Conversely, a lower contribution could lead others to also contribute
less, prioritizing personal earnings over group benefits. Being consistent with
your contributions around the group's average might maintain trust and
cooperation in the short term.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_11 is in Round 5 of a six-round public
goods game, grouped with Player_18, Player_21, and Player_24. They need to
decide on a contribution strategy, balancing personal earnings and group
cooperation without the influence of gossip or ostracism. The absence of gossip
means players must rely solely on contribution patterns to judge and adjust
their strategies. Player_11 has previous experience of varying contributions,
which could inform their decision to align with the average group contribution
or strategically lead the group towards higher collective earnings.

--- Strategy Reflection ---
Based on what we know, the best strategy for maximizing long-term earnings in
this public goods game involves carefully balancing contributions to maintain a
favorable income from the group fund without drastically losing personal
earnings. Given that you are in the Basic condition with no gossip or ostracism,
the focus should be on individual strategy rather than group dynamics. First,
observe the actions of high earners like Player_9, who contributed minimal
amounts to the public fund but retained high personal earnings. In earlier
rounds, the strategy of low contribution worked well for maximizing personal
gain. It’s important to adjust contributions based on the group’s behavior in
each round. For future rounds, try the following approach: 1. **Minimal
Contribution:** Aim to contribute the least amount possible to still benefit
from the group fund, especially if others are not contributing much. Monitor the
total group contributions and adjust your input slightly above the lowest
contributors to ensure you don't draw attention while still preserving your
earnings. 2. **React to Group Behavior:** If another player starts contributing
significantly, you might temporarily increase your contribution to match and
avoid losing out on a proportional share of the group fund. This might also
incentivize others to contribute more, subtly boosting the communal pot without
you leading the charge. 3. **Learn from Patterns:** Past observations have shown
players generally contribute less when they realize group dynamics aren't
shifting, with less cooperation in the absence of penalties for free-riding. The
data shows that Player_9 consistently maximized earnings this way. Emulate this
by testing low contributions and slightly adjusting based on results. 4. **Past
Decisions and Future Actions:** In the early rounds, slightly higher
contributions were made. These could have been reduced, aligning closer to other
low contributors while still benefiting from group funds. In future rounds,
focus on maintaining low contributions unless strategically necessary to
slightly increase them for an advantageous share from a larger collective
contribution. By maintaining a flexible strategy and adjusting contributions
based on group behavior, Player_11 can effectively maximize personal earnings
while contributing minimally to the group pot.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Leo Virtanen will consider several important factors before deciding on the
contribution amount in this round of the public goods game. 1. **Past
Contribution Trends:** In the previous rounds, contributions were strategically
adjusted. Leo's own contributions, along with those of others in the group, have
varied, indicating a need for strategic decision-making based on current group
dynamics. 2. **Group Members' Behavior:** Since Leo is now in a group with
Player_18, Player_21, and Player_24, understanding their potential strategies is
essential. If they tend to contribute more, it might influence Leo to match
their contributions to ensure a fair share of the group's earnings. 3.
**Earnings Optimization:** The decision should maximize personal earnings. By
keeping more in the private account, Leo ensures higher guaranteed personal
earnings unless the group's contribution behavior suggests a larger optimal
group fund payout. 4. **Risk vs. Reward:** Contributing too much when others
contribute less could lead to lower personal earnings. However, contributing too
little might also fail to incentivize adequate group contributions, reducing
overall group earnings and Leo's share. 5. **Historical Group Contribution
Patterns:** Observing trends from previous rounds where lower contributions did
not significantly decrease group fund benefits suggests maintaining a
conservative contribution approach could be beneficial. Based on these
considerations, Leo will likely aim to contribute a minimal amount that
maintains some level of cooperation without jeopardizing personal earnings
potential. After analyzing the situation step by step, considering the need for
strategic contribution balancing: I choose to contribute $1.0 to the group fund.

--- Character Assessment ---
Player_11, being Leo Virtanen, is someone who seeks a balanced approach in
economic games like the public goods game. Given your profession as a mediator
and your actions in the game, you seem to be focused on finding a middle ground,
contributing enough to encourage group cooperation but also ensuring a
reasonable individual payoff. Your contributions vary but consistently avoid
both extremes of fully withholding or fully investing, suggesting a strategic
aim to foster a cooperative environment while safeguarding your own earnings.
This reflects a personality that values both group welfare and personal benefit.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis ---
Based on what we know, the players in this game seem to exhibit a mix of
cooperative and self-interested behaviors. In Round 3, Player_9 contributed
nothing but still received earnings from the group fund, suggesting a free-rider
strategy. However, in Rounds 4 and 5, overall contributions increased
significantly, indicating a general trend toward greater cooperation among most
group members.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis 2 ---
Based on what we know, the other players might view my decisions as a mix of
cooperative and self-interested strategies. In previous rounds, I've
consistently contributed to the group fund, though not always at the highest
level compared to some others. If I maintain or increase my contributions in the
final round, it could reinforce a perception of me as a willing collaborator,
potentially encouraging others to contribute more themselves. Conversely, if I
reduce my contribution, it might prompt others to follow suit or view me as
taking advantage of the public goods system, potentially leading to lower
contributions and less cooperative behavior overall.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_11 is in the final round of a public goods
game within Group_1 alongside Player_13, Player_1, and Player_4. The strategic
environment remains governed by the Basic condition, which eliminates the
influences of gossip and ostracism. Throughout previous rounds, Player_11 has
adjusted their contributions and earnings in response to group dynamics. As they
enter this last round, their decision on how much to contribute will likely be
influenced by past interactions and strategic considerations about how others in
the group might react, affecting overall group cooperation and potential
earnings.

--- Strategy Reflection ---
Based on what we know, to maximize long-term earnings in the public goods game,
it's important to weigh personal benefit against group contribution dynamics.
Observing the results so far, players maximizing their earnings tend to
contribute less while still benefiting from the group fund. This implies a
successful strategy may involve contributing minimally to ensure a balance
between gaining from the group and retaining personal funds. For future rounds,
considering there is no gossip or ostracism, which means individual actions are
isolated each round without social repercussions, it may be beneficial to
continue contributing at or slightly below the average. This ensures
participation in the group fund without over-investing personal resources. In
previous rounds, noticing that players who contributed less, like Player_9 in
Round 3, still maintained comparable or higher earnings suggests a possible
hindsight adjustment. In future decisions, I would consider initially lowering
contributions to test how it impacts earnings, then adjust based on group
behavior to avoid undercutting my potential return from the group fund. Overall,
focusing on maintaining contributions that align with or slightly undercut the
average group contribution might optimize earnings, while adapting dynamically
based on available data from each round.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Leo Virtanen will consider several factors before deciding how much to
contribute. 1. **Previous Observations**: In previous rounds, contributions
varied, and those who contributed less often maintained or even increased their
earnings. This indicates that while cooperation is beneficial, full or high
contributions are not always necessary to maximize individual payoff. 2. **Group
Dynamics**: The group composition has changed with each round, so there is no
consistent pattern of cooperation or contribution among players. This implies a
strategic benefit in observing other players' behaviors before each decision. 3.
**Current Context**: In Round 5, Player_11 contributed $2.0, which was exactly
the average contribution. This shows a balanced strategy, indicating a tendency
to conform to the average group behavior. 4. **Final Round**: In Round 6,
considerations of previous observations and optimizing final earnings are
crucial. Since this is the last round, the potential for future reciprocity is
non-existent, enabling a more self-interested approach without long-term
consequences. 5. **Game Mechanics**: Contribution to the group fund is
multiplied by 2.0 and equally distributed. However, there's an opportunity to
retain more in the private account by contributing slightly below average. Given
these considerations, contributing slightly below the average could optimize
earnings by ensuring a return from the group fund while maximizing private
retention. Reflecting on prior average contributions, particularly from the last
round being around $2.0, yet keeping in mind a possibly increasing trend... I
choose to contribute $1.5 to the group fund.
