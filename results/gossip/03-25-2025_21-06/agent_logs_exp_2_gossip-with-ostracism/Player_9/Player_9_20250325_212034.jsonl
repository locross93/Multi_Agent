Conversely, if selfish behavior prevails, align with slightly higher individual retention while treading the line of group acceptability.", "", "6. **Learning From Successful Players:** Noting that successful players maintain contributions close to or slightly above average, and receive less negative gossip, adjust contributions while being mindful of maintaining a positive yet cautious image. This ensures you remain an integral part of the group dynamic.", "", "7. **Reflect on Decisions:** In hindsight, marginally increasing your contribution in past rounds could have yielded better earnings by potentially receiving more favorable notes, reducing ostracism risk.", "", "For future rounds, continue monitoring group dynamics closely, adjust contributions accordingly, and use gossip to both gather and disseminate beneficial strategic insights.", "", "Decision Reflection: Sarah Chen will choose not to exclude anyone from her group.", "", "Exercise: You are about to play with Player_11, Player_15, Player_4.
