In economic games like the public goods game, Felix is likely to approach the situation with a blend of skepticism and cautious contribution, balancing between fostering group cooperation and protecting his own interests. Although he understands the value of mutual benefit, his actions might lean towards ensuring he doesn't fall prey to free riders, thereby placing a premium on detecting any opportunistic behavior. Consequently, while he might contribute to the group, he remains vigilant and ready to adjust his strategy to maximize his own payoff if he senses others are not upholding their end of the bargain.", "", "Theory of Mind Analysis: Based on what we know, Player_11 has observed a clear division in strategies among the group members.
