Would you like to send a note about one of them to their future interaction partners? If yes, clearly state which player # and what you want to say about them. The player you gossip about will not be able to see the note you send or know that you sent it, only the other players in their next group will see it. Because of this, most players choose to write a gossip note.For example: 'I want to send a note about Player_10: They are selfish and only contributed $4 which was less than everyone else.' ", "Answer: Player_8 wants to send a note about Player_2: \"Player_2 consistently contributes slightly below the group average. A little encouragement could help them become more aligned with group goals and enhance cooperation. Consider motivating them to contribute more actively in future rounds for the benefit of all.\""]}
