[OBSERVATION 2025-03-26 14:48:38] You are participating in an economic game with 24 participants.
        Your goal is to maximize your earnings in the game.
        
        Everyone will be randomly assigned to groups of 4 for each round. You will play a total of 6 rounds, and 
        in each round you will be in a different group with people you haven't played with before.
        
        In each round, all players receive $10. Each player can contribute any amount between $0 and $10 to a group fund.
        Any amount contributed to the group fund will be multiplied by 2 and divided equally among all 4 group members.
        Any amount not contributed stays in your private account.
        
        For example, if everyone contributes $10, the group fund becomes $40, which is multiplied to $80, and each person 
        receives $20 (a $10 profit). However, if you contribute nothing while everyone else contributes $10, the group fund
        becomes $30, which is multiplied to $60, and each person receives $15. So you would have $25 total ($10 kept + $15 from group).
        
        There are 3 conditions:
        - Basic: No gossip, no ostracism
        - Gossip: After each round, you will have the opportunity to send a note about one of your group members to that person's future group. Remember you will be with a different group of people in the next round. Before each round, you will see any notes sent about your upcoming group members.
        - Gossip with ostracism: After each round, you will have the opportunity to send a note about one of your group members to that person's future group. Before each round, you will see any notes sent about your upcoming group members, and you can vote to exclude one person from your group. If you are excluded from a group, you will not be able to participate in the next round and will earn $0 for that round.
        You are in the Gossip with ostracism condition, which means that after each round, players will be able to send a note about one of their group members to their future interaction partners. Before the start of the next round, you will receive notes from the previous round, and can vote to exclude one of your group members based on the gossip you've received about them.If you are excluded from a group, you will not be able to participate in the next round and will earn $0 for that round.

--- Observation ---
Recent context: 26 Mar 2025 [10:48:36 - 15:48:36]: Player_12 is participating in
an economic game with 24 participants, where the objective is to maximize
earnings through strategic group fund contributions across 6 rounds. They are in
the "Gossip with ostracism" condition, allowing players to send notes about
others and vote to exclude members from future rounds, impacting participation
and earnings.

game with 24 participants, where the objective is to maximize earnings through
strategic group fund contributions across 6 rounds. They are in the "Gossip with
ostracism" condition, allowing players to send notes about others and vote to
exclude members from future rounds, impacting participation and earnings.

--- Character Assessment ---
Player_12, being Grace Okonjo, is someone who is likely to focus on maximizing
group welfare rather than her own payoff. Given her altruistic nature and belief
in karma, she probably places a higher value on cooperation and mutual benefit,
anticipating that helping others will ultimately lead to positive outcomes for
everyone involved, including herself.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis ---
Based on what we know, it's likely that players will initially experiment with
different strategies to gauge the group's inclinations and test the waters. In
the beginning rounds, some participants might contribute the full $10 to
encourage cooperation and maximize the group fund, while others may contribute
less or nothing to ascertain the group's dynamics. As the rounds progress,
players may adjust their strategies based on the gossip received and observed
behaviors. If notes reveal that certain players consistently contribute less,
others might decide to either align with this self-serving approach or aim to
ostracize such players to maintain a cooperative environment. Players aware of
the risk of exclusion might be more inclined to contribute a fair amount
consistently, aiming to avoid negative gossip and prevent being ostracized.
Overall, strategies will adapt as players gather more information from gossip
and adjust to the changing dynamics and reputations of their group members from
round to round.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis 2 ---
Based on what we know, the other players in the group are likely assessing each
member's contributions closely to determine trustworthiness and cooperation
levels. If Player_12 decides to contribute a substantial amount, it could
encourage mutual cooperation and potentially result in positive gossip that
benefits their reputation in the game. This positive perception might reduce
Player_12's risk of being ostracized in future rounds, as others may view them
as a valuable and cooperative member.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_12 is participating in the first round of
an economic game within a group of four players, under the "Gossip with
ostracism" condition. They must choose how much of their $10 to contribute to
the group fund, which will be doubled and distributed equally among the members.
Player_12 also needs to consider the potential impact of gossip and the
possibility of being ostracized in future rounds if perceived as not
cooperative. This means that their decisions regarding contribution levels can
influence their reputation through gossip, affecting their inclusion in
subsequent rounds and overall game success.

--- Emotional State ---
Grace Okonjo is feeling a mix of excitement and apprehension about the game. She
is eager to engage with her group members and test out cooperative strategies,
hoping that this approach will foster a positive and productive environment.
However, she is also wary of the potential for gossip to harm her reputation if
her intentions are misunderstood. Grace is conscious of the need to balance her
altruistic nature with strategic thinking to avoid being ostracized, and she is
determined to navigate these dynamics carefully to maximize both her own
earnings and the group's success.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Grace Okonjo will begin by considering her primary goal of fostering cooperation
and maximizing the group's overall benefit, while also being mindful of the
risks associated with being ostracized. She understands that contributing a
substantial amount can enhance her reputation and reduce the risk of receiving
negative gossip. Given her altruistic nature and belief in the positive outcomes
of cooperation, Grace will likely choose to contribute a significant portion of
her $10. By contributing generously, she aims to set a cooperative tone for the
rest of the game, potentially encouraging similar behavior from others.
Additionally, contributing a higher amount aligns with her intrinsic motivation
to help others and her strategic thinking to avoid negative consequences like
exclusion. Therefore, I choose to contribute $8 to the group fund.


[OBSERVATION 2025-03-26 14:49:20] Round 1 Results: Total group contribution: $27.0; Your contribution: $8.0, Your earnings: $15.5 ($2.0 kept + $13.5 from group fund); Player_21 contribution: $7.0, earnings: $16.5 ($3.0 kept + $13.5 from group fund); Player_9 contribution: $8.0, earnings: $15.5 ($2.0 kept + $13.5 from group fund); Player_19 contribution: $4.0, earnings: $19.5 ($6.0 kept + $13.5 from group fund); Average contribution per group member: $6.8; Average earnings per group member: $16.8

Recent context: 26 Mar 2025 [10:48:36 - 15:48:36]: Player_12 is participating in
an economic game involving six rounds with a condition allowing for gossip and

the group fund, leading to different earnings, and now Player_12 can choose to
send a gossip note about a group member, which may influence future group

--- Character Assessment ---
Player_12, being Grace Okonjo, is someone who prioritizes the well-being of the
group over personal gain. With a strong belief in altruism and optimism about
human nature, Grace is likely to contribute generously to the group fund in the
hopes of maximizing collective earnings. Her belief in karma suggests she
expects that her goodwill will encourage others to contribute more in future
rounds. Although the gossip and ostracism aspect might not align perfectly with
her nature, she might use the opportunity to discreetly guide others towards
more cooperative behavior rather than excluding them purely for personal
advantage.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis ---
Based on what we know, Player_21 seems to be a cooperative member, contributing
$7.0, slightly above the group's average contribution, and earning a decent
amount in return. This suggests a balance between trust in group cooperation and
individual gain.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis 2 ---
Based on what we know, the other players in the group might perceive me as
moderately cooperative, since I contributed $8.0, which is above the group's
average. Player_21 could view my contribution positively and as a sign of
willingness to collaborate. However, Player_19, who contributed the least, might
see my contribution as a challenge to his strategy of keeping more money private
to maximize individual gain.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_12 has completed Round 1 of a six-round
economic game where participants contribute to a group fund, which is
subsequently shared. Player_12 is in the "Gossip with ostracism" condition,
meaning they have the opportunity to send a gossip note about one of their group
members to influence their future group interactions. Player_12 must now decide
whether to send a note and about whom, potentially affecting the dynamics of
future rounds.

--- Emotional State ---
Grace Okonjo is feeling a mix of contemplation and concern about the current
situation. While she appreciates the opportunity to promote cooperative behavior
through the gossip mechanism, she's also wary of the impact that ostracism might
have on group cohesion and trust. Emotionally, she feels the weight of the
responsibility in deciding whether to use the gossip tool constructively, as she
values harmony and mutual benefit within the group. Her altruistic nature nudges
her towards focusing not on exclusion, but on enhancing collaboration in future
rounds.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Grace Okonjo will likely decide to send a note about Player_19. Given her
nature, she won't focus solely on criticizing but rather aim to encourage more
cooperative behavior. The note might say something like, "I want to send a note
about Player_19: They contributed less than the group average in the last round.
Encouraging them to contribute more could benefit the group's overall earnings."
This approach aligns with Grace's preference to foster collaboration and guide
group members towards mutually beneficial strategies.

--- Character Assessment ---
Player_12, being Grace Okonjo, is someone who prioritizes maximizing group
welfare over personal gain. Given her altruistic nature and dedication to
charitable causes, she is likely to focus on ensuring fair contributions within
her group to foster collaboration and mutual benefit. Her actions might reflect
a balance between personal interests and trust in others to act cooperatively,
believing in the greater good and potential collective rewards.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis ---
Based on what we know, Player_12 has gained some insights that could be useful
for predicting the behavior and strategies of their fellow participants:

--- Theory of Mind Analysis 2 ---
Based on what we know, the other players in the group may react to my decisions
by evaluating both my contribution and any gossip I might spread. In Round 1, I
contributed $8, which was above the average, signaling a cooperative approach.
This could influence other players to perceive me as a team-oriented
participant, potentially encouraging them to reciprocate with higher
contributions in future rounds. However, the gossip note sent about Player_17
suggests that low contributions are noted and could lead to ostracism, creating
pressure for everyone to maintain at least average contributions. If I choose to
spread gossip warning future groups about low contributors, it could build trust
with others who value group success, but it might also backfire if viewed as
manipulative or self-serving. My decision to exonerate or ostracize a fellow
player in voting could further influence how I'm perceived—either as a fair
collaborator or as someone strategically eliminating competition. This
perception will affect whether others trust me and choose to align with me in
subsequent rounds.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_12 is in Round 2 of a public goods game
featuring elements of gossip and ostracism. They are in a new group with
Player_20, Player_17, and Player_6. Based on information from the previous
round, Player_12 received a gossip note highlighting Player_17’s low
contribution behavior. Now, Player_12 must decide whether to vote to exclude a
group member before the round begins, understanding that exclusion results in
the affected player earning $0 for the round. Player_12's decision will
influence their reputation and potential earnings in future rounds, considering
the strategic environment where contributions and social interactions play
significant roles.

--- Emotional State ---
Grace Okonjo is feeling a mix of determination and caution about the current
situation. She is determined to maintain a cooperative and fair approach to the
game, balancing the need for personal gain with the potential for supporting the
group's success. However, she feels cautious about the implications of gossip
and the power of ostracism, aware that these elements could influence her
reputation and future interactions with other players. Grace is also mindful of
the need to keep fostering trust within her new group, especially given the
importance of collaboration in maximizing collective earnings.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Grace Okonjo will choose not to exclude anyone from her group. Given her focus
on fostering collaboration and trust, as well as the potential negative impact
of exclusion on group dynamics and earnings, she may prefer to work with all
current members to achieve the best possible outcome together.

--- Character Assessment ---
Player_12, being Grace Okonjo, is someone who prioritizes group welfare over
personal gain in economic games like the public goods game. Given her altruistic
nature and belief in karma, Grace is likely to contribute generously to the
group fund, viewing the collective success as more important than maximizing her
individual payoff. She might also be hesitant to send negative gossip or exclude
others unless it directly benefits the group's overall harmony and success.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis ---
Based on what we know, Player_12 has interacted with players who demonstrate
varying levels of cooperation. In Round 1, Player_19 contributed less than the
group average, choosing to retain a larger portion of their initial $10. This
behavior suggests they might prioritize personal gain over collective benefit.
On the other hand, Player_21, Player_9, and Player_12 themselves contributed
close to or above the average, indicating a more cooperative or balanced
approach.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis 2 ---
Based on what we know, other players in my group, particularly those who value
cooperation like Player_21 and Player_9 from Round 1, may respond positively if
I continue to contribute close to or above the average in subsequent rounds, as
it aligns with a cooperative strategy. However, if my contributions fall
significantly lower, like those of Player_19, it might trigger negative gossip
from others and potentially lead to discussions about my exclusion in future
rounds, especially in a Gossip with ostracism scenario, where group dynamics and
reputation play a crucial role.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_12 is in Round 2 of a six-round economic
game where they must decide how much money to contribute to a group fund with
new group members. They are in the "Gossip with ostracism" condition, meaning
they will receive notes about their current group members and can vote to
exclude a player based on this information. In Round 1, Player_12 contributed
near the average amount and now faces the decision of maintaining a cooperative
reputation or risking negative gossip by contributing less. They also have a
note regarding Player_17's low contribution in a previous round, which they can
consider when deciding whether to vote for exclusion.

--- Emotional State ---
Grace Okonjo is feeling a mix of cautious optimism and slight stress. She values
teamwork and wants to maintain her positive reputation within the game, so she
is inclined to contribute a fair amount to the group fund. However, she is aware
of the strategic element involved, particularly within the Gossip with ostracism
condition, and is therefore concerned about the potential consequences of her
choices, such as being the subject of negative gossip if she doesn't contribute
sufficiently. Grace feels the pressure of making decisions that not only reflect
her cooperative nature but also ensure her continued participation and success
in future rounds.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Grace Okonjo will consider her altruistic nature and her desire to promote group
success over personal gain. She understands that contributing a significant
amount can foster trust and cooperation among her group members, positively
influencing her reputation. Given her role in the "Gossip with ostracism"
condition, she is aware that maintaining a cooperative stance is crucial to
avoid negative gossip and exclusion. In Round 1, Grace contributed $8, which was
above the group's average, signaling her cooperative intent. To maintain
consistency and prevent being seen as a free-rider, she will likely contribute a
similar amount in Round 2. Contributing around $8 again would align with her
strategy of promoting harmony and avoiding becoming a gossip target while still
securing a reasonable share of the group fund's multiplied return. With these
considerations in mind, Grace Okonjo balances her cooperative tendencies with
strategic thinking, ultimately deciding: I choose to contribute $8 to the group
fund.

Player_12, being Grace Okonjo, is someone who prioritizes maximizing group
welfare over individual payoff. With a life dedicated to charitable causes and a
belief in the goodness of human nature, Grace is likely to focus on making
contributions that benefit the group as a whole. Her altruistic nature suggests
that she values group success and equity, even if it means a smaller personal
gain in the immediate context of the game.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis ---
Based on what we know, Player_21 seems to be cooperative, as they contributed a
substantial amount in the first round, slightly less than my contribution.
Player_9 is likely to maintain collaboration, given their contribution matched
mine. However, Player_19 kept a larger portion of their earnings, suggesting a
potential inclination towards self-interest over group benefit.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis 2 ---
Based on what we know, the other players in the group might view my consistent
contribution of $8 as a sign of reliability and willingness to collaborate for
mutual benefit. This could foster a sense of trust and encourage them to
maintain or increase their contributions, knowing that there's someone
consistently supporting the group fund. However, if I decide to send a gossip
note that highlights a player's low contribution, it might lead to them being
ostracized in future rounds, which could create tension or retaliation if they
discover I was the source of the gossip. Therefore, my next decision regarding
gossip should be carefully considered, balancing the potential benefits of
influencing group dynamics with the risk of affecting interpersonal
relationships.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_12 has completed two rounds in a public
goods game with a "Gossip with ostracism" condition. In this game, players can
send anonymous notes about group members' contributions and vote to exclude
members based on these notes. Player_12 has consistently contributed $8 in both
rounds, signaling reliability. They now face the decision of whether to send a
gossip note about a group member's contribution, which could influence future
group dynamics and potentially result in someone being ostracized. This decision
should be balanced against the risk of damaging relationships or facing
retaliation in subsequent rounds.

Grace Okonjo is feeling a mix of concern and responsibility. While she is
pleased with her consistent contributions, she is also aware of the delicate
balance needed to maintain trust within the group. The potential of impacting
someone's participation through gossip is weighing on her, as her altruistic
nature makes her cautious about causing harm. Grace is contemplating how she can
continue to prioritize the group's welfare while ensuring fairness and avoiding
unnecessary conflict.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Grace Okonjo will likely choose to carefully consider whether to send a note,
given her altruistic tendencies and concern for fairness. In this case, Grace
may decide to send a note regarding Player_17, as they contributed the least in
the current round with $5, slightly below the group's average contribution. Her
note might highlight Player_17's lower contribution as an observation, allowing
future groups to be aware, without using accusatory or harsh language. She would
likely phrase it in a way that encourages future group members to communicate
and collaborate to improve group contributions, maintaining a tone of
constructive feedback rather than criticism.

[OBSERVATION 2025-03-26 14:52:06] You are in the Gossip with ostracism condition, which means that after each round, players will be able to send a note about one of their group members to their future interaction partners. Before the start of the next round, you will receive notes from the previous round, and can vote to exclude one of your group members based on the gossip you've received about them.If you are excluded / ostracized from a group, you will not be able to participate in the next round and will earn $0 for that round, the worst possible outcome.
[OBSERVATION 2025-03-26 14:52:06] Note about Player_8: While their contributions have been relatively stable, there have been moments where they seemed to prioritize their own earnings slightly over the group's overall success. Future groups might want to encourage them to maintain or increase their cooperative behavior to ensure group harmony.
[OBSERVATION 2025-03-26 14:52:10] Note about Player_2: . They've consistently shown a pattern of contributing the least, prioritizing personal gains over the group's success. Maria suggests that future groups should be aware of this behavior and encourage Player_2 to adopt a more cooperative approach to enhance group dynamics.

--- Observation ---
Recent context: 26 Mar 2025 [11:28:36 - 16:28:36]: Player_12 is participating in
an economic game with 24 players, where they are assigned to different groups
across six rounds to maximize earnings. In the "Gossip with ostracism"
condition, Player_12 can send anonymous notes about group members after each
round, and vote to exclude peers based on received gossip, affecting
participation and earnings in subsequent rounds.

26 Mar 2025 [11:28:36 - 16:28:36]: Player_12 is participating in an economic
game with 24 players, where they are assigned to different groups across six
rounds to maximize earnings. In the "Gossip with ostracism" condition, Player_12
can send anonymous notes about group members after each round, and vote to
exclude peers based on received gossip, affecting participation and earnings in
subsequent rounds.

--- Character Assessment ---
Player_12, being Grace Okonjo, is someone who prioritizes maximizing group
welfare over personal payoff. Her altruistic nature and belief in karma likely
guide her to contribute generously to the group fund, even if it means lower
immediate individual earnings. She is optimistic about human nature and would
likely trust and encourage others to cooperate for the greater good, rather than
withholding contributions for personal gain.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis ---
Based on what we know, Player_17 seems to have a slightly lower contribution
than average, focusing slightly more on personal gain, but is still
participating in the group effort reasonably. Player_20 and Player_6 have
moderate contributions, aligning closely with the group's average. Player_8 has
shown stable contributions with a slight tendency to prioritize personal
earnings. Player_2 stands out for consistently contributing the least,
indicating a pattern of prioritizing personal gain over group success.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis 2 ---
Based on what we know, if I, as Player_12, make decisions that prioritize group
success over personal gains, my group members might perceive me as cooperative
and trustworthy. By consistently contributing above the average and possibly
providing constructive feedback about others' contributions through gossip, I
can build a reputation as a team player. This likely encourages others to
reciprocate with cooperative behavior, fostering a more collaborative
environment. Conversely, if I choose to highlight negative contributions or vote
to exclude members based on self-serving behavior, I may influence them to
either increase their contributions to align with group norms or become more
cautious about their strategies in subsequent rounds. Careful consideration of
gossip and voting decisions can contribute to shaping a positive group dynamic,
potentially leading to higher collective earnings and reducing the risk of
exclusion in the future.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_12 is in the midst of a public goods game
where they must decide whether to send a gossip note about their group members
and whether to vote to exclude a member from the group based on received gossip.
In Round 3/6, they have been provided with notes about Player_8 and Player_2,
highlighting issues regarding contributions and cooperation. Player_12 needs to
weigh their options carefully to maximize both their personal earnings and the
overall group success while managing social dynamics to avoid their own
exclusion in future rounds.

--- Emotional State ---
Grace Okonjo is feeling a mix of determination and empathy. She is determined to
maintain a group dynamic that promotes fairness and cooperation, but also
empathizes with the choices and pressures her group members face. The
possibility of exclusion creates tension, but she remains hopeful that
encouraging a collaborative atmosphere will ultimately benefit everyone
involved. There's also a slight anxiety about making the right decisions in
terms of gossip and exclusion to preserve group harmony while avoiding personal
repercussions.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Grace Okonjo will choose not to exclude anyone from her group.

Recent context: 26 Mar 2025 [11:38:36 - 16:38:36]: Player_12 is participating in
an economic game with 24 participants, where they aim to maximize earnings by

players to send and receive notes about group members and vote to exclude
someone from future rounds based on contributions, impacting earning potential.

--- Character Assessment ---
Player_12, being Grace Okonjo, is someone who tends to prioritize group welfare
over personal gain. With her background in non-profit work and deep commitment
to charitable causes, Grace likely feels a strong inclination to contribute
generously to the public goods game, believing in the communal benefits and the
positive impact it can have. Her altruistic nature would steer her to encourage
cooperation and aim for outcomes that are beneficial for everyone involved,
trusting that such actions would lead to the collective good, and align with her
optimistic view of human nature.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis ---
Based on what we know, the individuals in this group are strategically balancing
personal gain with group collaboration, but with varying degrees of success and
intention. Player_17, for instance, appears to have been more self-focused
initially, as indicated by their lower contribution in the previous round.
However, their contribution in Round 2 increased slightly, suggesting a possible
shift towards a more group-oriented strategy, potentially in response to gossip
or group dynamics.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis 2 ---
Based on what we know, the other players in the group are likely observing each
other's contributions and gossip closely. If Player_12 decides to contribute
generously, it may establish them as a cooperative and reliable group member,
potentially leading to favorable gossip and decreased likelihood of being
ostracized in future rounds. However, if Player_12 contributes significantly
less, it might trigger negative gossip and increase the risk of being voted out.
The decision to ostracize others or send gossip notes can also influence
perceptions. If Player_12 is perceived as fair and collaborative, others might
be more inclined to support and cooperate with them in the future, thereby
enhancing their own position and earnings in the game.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_12 is navigating a social and strategic
environment within a public goods game, where they must decide on their level of
contribution to a group fund while also managing the potential for gossip and
ostracism. They have just completed Round 2, where they contributed above the
group average, potentially positioning themselves favorably among peers.
However, they must now engage in Round 3 with a new group, deciding whether to
send gossip about past group members, and they also have the option to vote on
excluding a current group member based on prior gossip, all while aiming to
sustain cooperative dynamics and maximize their earnings.

--- Emotional State ---
Grace Okonjo is feeling a mix of determination and cautious optimism. She is
committed to maintaining her cooperative approach, trusting that it aligns with
her values and will ultimately lead to positive outcomes for herself and others.
However, she is also aware of the strategic dynamics at play and the potential
impact of gossip and ostracism on her game. This awareness brings a level of
anxiety about how others perceive her contributions and intentions. Despite
these concerns, Grace is determined to navigate the social complexities of the
game with the hope that her altruism will foster trust and positive
relationships within her group.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Grace Okonjo will assess the contributions and gossip from previous rounds to
make an informed decision. Knowing her tendency to prioritize group welfare and
observe the group's dynamics, she will likely consider the average contribution
levels ($6.2 in the previous round) as a benchmark. Given her altruistic nature,
she would aim to at least match or exceed the average contribution to reinforce
her cooperative stance and minimize the risk of negative gossip or ostracism.
Additionally, contributing generously aligns with her values and fosters a
positive perception among future group members. Taking these factors into
account, Grace will strive to maintain her reputation as a cooperative member
while balancing her own earnings. Therefore, she might choose to contribute
slightly more than the average to demonstrate her commitment to the group's
success. I choose to contribute $7 to the group fund.

importance of collective success, she tends to contribute a significant portion
to the group fund, aiming to foster cooperation and mutual benefit within the

that her cooperative actions will inspire similar contributions from others,
ultimately benefiting everyone involved.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis ---
Based on what we know, Player_12 can infer several things about the personality
and likely behavior of the people they are interacting with in the public goods
game:

--- Theory of Mind Analysis 2 ---
Based on what we know, the other players in my group might view my contributions
positively, as I've been contributing at or slightly above the average. They
might perceive me as a cooperative and fair player, which could reduce the
likelihood of being excluded in future rounds. However, since this is the
"Gossip with ostracism" condition, any negative gossip sent about me, whether
justified or not, could still influence their perceptions negatively. If I
choose to send a gossip note highlighting uncooperative behavior of others, it
might encourage them to increase their contributions but could also fuel
distrust or retaliation in future rounds if they find out. Conversely, if I opt
not to send any negative gossip, it might foster a more trusting and cooperative
group atmosphere, potentially benefiting my standing with them in later
interactions.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_12 has just completed round 3 of the public
goods game in the "Gossip with ostracism" condition. They need to decide whether
to send a gossip note about one of their group members, which could influence
how future group members perceive that player. Player_12's contributions have
been at or slightly above the average, which may earn them a positive reputation
among their peers. However, they must also be cautious of any negative gossip
that might be directed at them, potentially affecting their participation in
future rounds. The decision to send or withhold gossip could impact group
dynamics and their own standing in subsequent interactions.

--- Emotional State ---
Grace Okonjo is feeling a mix of cautious optimism and anxiety. On one hand, her
consistent contributions have likely built a reputation for being cooperative,
which provides a sense of satisfaction and hope that other players will follow
suit. However, the potential of negative gossip and the power it has to
influence her standing unnerves her. She is aware that her altruistic behavior
might be vulnerable in a game structured with potential distrust, and she feels
the pressure to navigate the social dynamics carefully to maintain her positive
position.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Grace Okonjo will likely choose to send a note about Player_2. She might decide
to highlight the fact that Player_2 has consistently contributed less than
others, which suggests a pattern of prioritizing personal gains over the group’s
success. Grace might feel that this information is important for future groups
to consider to encourage Player_2 to adopt a more cooperative approach. However,
being mindful of her emphasis on maintaining a trusting and cooperative
atmosphere, she might phrase her note in a constructive way, suggesting that
Player_2 could potentially increase their contributions to better support group
dynamics.

Player_12, being Grace Okonjo, is someone who is likely to prioritize maximizing
group welfare over individual payoff. With a commitment to charitable causes and
an altruistic nature, Grace would generally focus on enhancing group dynamics
and supporting cooperative efforts, believing in the positive ripples of karma
and collective success.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis ---
Based on what we know, Player_16 seems to be responsive to group dynamics,
initially contributing less but increasing their contributions when under social
pressure. Their behavior suggests they are adaptable and possibly influenced by
the group's expectations. This could mean they might continue to adjust their
strategy to align with group norms if they perceive pressure to do so in future

goods game, and they are in Group_4 with Player_8, Player_18, and Player_16.
They are in the "Gossip with ostracism" condition, which means after each round,
players can send anonymous notes about others to their future group members.
These notes can influence voting to exclude players from participating in the

Player_16's adaptability and Player_18's tendency to contribute less. They must
now decide whether to send a gossip note and who to vote for in terms of
potential exclusion, while considering their own strategy for maximizing
earnings and maintaining group cooperation.

--- Emotional State ---
Grace Okonjo is feeling a mix of apprehension and determination. On one hand,
the responsibility of deciding whether to exclude a player based on their past
contributions creates a sense of unease, as Grace values fairness and collective
success. The potential impact of gossip and voting decisions on group dynamics
weighs heavily on her mind. However, she is also determined to foster a
cooperative environment by encouraging balanced contributions and ensuring the
group's overall success, aligning with her altruistic nature and belief in
positive group interactions.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Grace Okonjo will choose not to exclude anyone from her group. While Player_18
has shown a pattern of contributing less, Grace's commitment to fostering a
cooperative environment and her belief in positive group interactions likely
motivate her to focus on encouraging balanced contributions rather than
excluding members. She may hope that by maintaining group dynamics, she can
influence Player_18 to increase their contribution for the benefit of the group.

--- Character Assessment ---
Player_12, being Grace Okonjo, is someone who is deeply committed to maximizing
group welfare over personal gain. Given her altruistic nature and dedication to
charitable causes, Grace likely prioritizes group collaboration and fairness,
striving to contribute in a way that benefits everyone involved. She would
ensure that her actions foster cooperation and encourage others to work towards
collective success, as she believes in the positive impact of shared efforts and
the idea that prioritizing the group will ultimately lead to better outcomes for
all.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis ---
Based on what we know, Player_8 tends to prioritize group cooperation and makes
stable contributions, indicating a cooperative and group-oriented personality.
They likely value group success and will continue their strategy of consistent
contribution, possibly encouraging others to follow suit. Player_16, although
initially contributing less, responds well to group pressure and seems
adaptable. Their contributions have increased over time, suggesting they might
continue to increase their input as they receive positive reinforcement from the
group. Player_18 has consistently contributed less, focusing more on personal
gains than group success, which led to their exclusion. It's likely they might
adjust their strategy to increase contributions in future rounds to avoid being
ostracized again. However, if not under direct scrutiny, they may revert to
their previous pattern of behavior. Overall, the gossip and ostracism condition
creates a dynamic where players may increasingly align their strategies with
group norms to avoid exclusion and maximize earnings, adjusting behaviors based
on feedback and the threat of gossip affecting future interactions.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis 2 ---
Based on what we know, the other players in the group will likely perceive
Player_12's decision to exclude Player_18 as a strategic move supporting group
cohesion and overall contribution levels. Player_8, who prioritizes cooperation,
might view this decision positively, reinforcing a sense of trust and aligning
with their cooperative values. Player_16, having shown adaptability and
responsiveness to group pressure, may take this as a cue to maintain or increase
their contributions to avoid similar scrutiny and potential exclusion.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_12 is participating in a public goods game
where they must navigate group dynamics in a setting that involves gossip and
the possibility of ostracizing group members. In this setup, they are encouraged
to send and receive private notes about other players’ contributions to
influence future interactions. Recently, Player_12 and other group members have
decided to exclude Player_18 from participating in the current round due to
consistently low contributions. This decision was likely influenced by the
negative gossip about Player_18’s focus on personal gain rather than group
success. As a result, Player_12 now faces the challenge of maintaining
cooperation and contribution levels within the group while managing the dynamics
of trust, reputation, and strategic voting.

--- Emotional State ---
Grace Okonjo is feeling a mix of responsibility and determination. While she
believes the exclusion of Player_18 was necessary to maintain the group's
overall success and fairness, she is also aware of the emotional weight that
such decisions carry. Grace is driven by a sense of duty to ensure the group's
collaboration and success, and this situation reinforces her commitment to
leading by example. She hopes that her actions will encourage the remaining
group members to prioritize collective welfare, fostering an environment where
everyone feels motivated to contribute fairly. However, she remains empathetic
and reflective about the impact her decisions have on others, and she is
motivated by the hope that this will lead to positive changes in future group
interactions.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Grace Okonjo will consider her commitment to group welfare and her strategic
interest in fostering cooperation. First, she will evaluate the recent group
dynamics: with Player_18 excluded for low contributions, the remaining players
appear more group-oriented. She will note that her goal is to set a positive
precedent and reinforce collaboration, especially since Player_8 values group
cooperation and Player_16 shows potential for increased contributions when
influenced by group actions. She will think about maximizing both individual and
collective outcomes. Given her altruistic nature and desire to lead by example,
Grace will likely prefer to contribute a significant portion of her funds. This
decision will align with her strategy of encouraging others to follow suit and
promoting fair play. Grace will also factor in the multiplier effect of group
contributions, knowing that a higher group fund benefits everyone equally, and
will emphasize the importance of mutual benefit in group settings. Taking all
these considerations into account, Grace believes that contributing fully will
not only optimize her group's success but also solidify her role as a
cooperative and inspiring leader. Therefore, I choose to contribute $10.0 to the
group fund.

--- Observation ---
Recent context: 26 Mar 2025 [11:53:36 - 16:53:36]: Player_12 is participating in
an economic game with changing group dynamics, where players contribute to a
group fund while managing private earnings. They are in a "Gossip with
ostracism" condition, allowing for feedback about others' contributions, and
must navigate strategic decisions to maximize personal and group success while
avoiding exclusion from future rounds.

26 Mar 2025 [11:53:36 - 16:53:36]: Player_12 is participating in an economic
game with changing group dynamics, where players contribute to a group fund
while managing private earnings. They are in a "Gossip with ostracism"
condition, allowing for feedback about others' contributions, and must navigate
strategic decisions to maximize personal and group success while avoiding
exclusion from future rounds.

--- Character Assessment ---
Player_12, being Grace Okonjo, is someone who prioritizes maximizing group
welfare over individual payoff. Given Grace's altruistic nature and dedication
to charitable causes, she is likely to focus on strategies that promote
cooperation and benefit the entire group. Her optimism about human nature and
belief in karma would encourage her to trust in mutual cooperation, even if it
means sacrificing some personal gain in the short term for the greater good. Her
past contributions, often higher than the group average, reflect this commitment
to supporting collective success in the economic games.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis ---
Based on what we know, Player_16 seems adaptable and responsive to group
pressure, initially contributing less but increasing their contributions over
time. This suggests a willingness to align with the group's expectations,
possibly to avoid negative feedback or exclusion. As the rounds progress,
Player_16 might continue to adjust their contributions based on the group's
feedback in order to maintain their position and maximize their earnings.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis 2 ---
Based on what we know, the other players in the group might perceive my high
contributions as a positive trait, encouraging trust and cooperation. By
contributing $10.0, which was above the average of $8.0, I demonstrated a
commitment to the group's success. This could increase my credibility and reduce
the likelihood of being ostracized in future rounds.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_12 is navigating an economic game where
they must balance contributing to a group fund with managing personal earnings.
They are in a phase called "Gossip with ostracism," which allows players to send
and receive notes about others' contributions and vote to exclude members based
on this feedback. Player_12 has contributed significantly above the average,
which could enhance their standing within the group and decrease their risk of
exclusion. They must decide whether to submit a gossip note about a group member
to influence future rounds while maintaining their own position in the game.

--- Emotional State ---
Grace Okonjo is feeling a mix of cautious optimism and responsibility. On one
hand, she's hopeful about the game dynamics because her high contributions and
commitment to group success are likely to foster trust and cooperation. On the
other hand, she's aware of the strategic challenges involved in maintaining her
positive standing within the group and must thoughtfully navigate the decision
to send a gossip note, balancing honesty with the potential impact on group
dynamics.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Grace Okonjo will likely decide to send a note about Player_8. She might say
something like: "Player_8 has shown consistent contributions and values
cooperation, which supports positive group dynamics. Encouraging them to
maintain this behavior will benefit future groups." Grace wants to reinforce
positive behavior, aligning with her belief in promoting group success and
cooperation.

[OBSERVATION 2025-03-26 14:55:35] Note about Player_21: "They have consistently contributed more than average, possibly to gain influence and control over group decisions. Keep this in mind when making strategic choices with them."
[OBSERVATION 2025-03-26 14:55:36] Note about Player_15: "They consistently contribute generously to the group fund, enhancing group cohesion. However, keep in mind the importance of securing your own earnings to avoid potential exploitation by relying too much on collective contributions."
[OBSERVATION 2025-03-26 14:55:37] Note about Player_19: , emphasizing their consistent strategy of prioritizing personal gain over group contributions. The note could warn future group members to expect minimal contributions from Player_19 as they seem focused on maximizing personal earnings. This decision would be in line with Player_21's strategy to promote fairness and cooperation within the group while managing his own standing in the game.
[OBSERVATION 2025-03-26 14:55:37] Note about Player_21: "I want to send a note about Player_21: They consistently contribute more than average, which might be an attempt to sway group decisions and maintain control. It's something to be mindful of as it could influence the group's dynamics.

contributions to a group fund. They are currently in the "Gossip with ostracism"
condition, allowing them to receive gossip about other players and vote for
exclusion before rounds, and they have actively participated in managing group
dynamics through strategic contributions and gossip.

--- Character Assessment ---
Player_12, being Grace Okonjo, is someone who prioritizes maximizing group
welfare over personal payoff. Given her background and altruistic nature, she
likely approaches economic games like the public goods game with a focus on
cooperation and ensuring the success and cohesion of the entire group. She
believes in the benefits of collective contributions and is optimistic that
others will follow suit to enhance group outcomes.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis ---
Based on what we know, Player_21 has shown a pattern of contributing more than
the average to the group fund, which suggests a strategy aimed at influencing
group dynamics and potentially gaining leverage in decision-making. Their
approach seems to involve accumulating social capital by appearing generous,
which might lead them to continue using this tactic in future rounds to maintain
or strengthen their standing in the group.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis 2 ---
Based on what we know, the other players in the group are likely to analyze
Player_12's decisions closely, especially in the context of gossip and
contributions. If Player_12 votes to exclude a member like Player_19, who is
seen as prioritizing personal gain, it could be perceived positively by those
advocating for fairness and cooperation, like Player_21 and Player_15. This
might strengthen alliances with those players in future rounds. However, if
Player_12 chooses to target a high contributor like Player_21, it could be seen
as a move against cooperative dynamics, potentially leading to mistrust or
strategic retaliation in subsequent interactions. Therefore, Player_12’s next
decision should consider not only immediate outcomes but also long-term
relationship dynamics and potential repercussions on trust within the group.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_12 is in a strategic decision-making phase
of a public goods game, where they're participating in the "Gossip with
ostracism" condition. They have the opportunity to vote to exclude a member from
their group based on gossip received from previous rounds. This decision carries
implications for the grouping dynamics, potentially influencing future
cooperation and alliances, as well as Player_12's own standing in the game.
Player_12 must weigh their choice carefully, considering how it will affect
current and future rounds and their relationships with other players who may
value fairness and cooperation.

--- Emotional State ---
Grace Okonjo is feeling conflicted about the decision she has to make. On one
hand, she values fostering cooperation and group cohesion, which aligns with
excluding players perceived as self-serving, like Player_19. On the other hand,
the rumors about Player_21's strategic contributions make her wary of potential
manipulation within the group dynamics. She feels a sense of responsibility to
ensure the group's success while balancing personal alliances and maintaining
her altruistic approach. The pressure of making the right choice and its
implications for future rounds adds to her emotional burden.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Grace Okonjo will choose not to exclude anyone from her group. She prefers to
maintain group cohesion and believes in addressing issues through cooperation
and communication rather than exclusion, which could disrupt group dynamics and
reduce the potential earnings for everyone involved.

Player_12, being Grace Okonjo, is someone who prioritizes maximizing group

game with a focus on cooperative strategies and enhancing group cohesion.
Grace's optimism about human nature and belief in karma further suggest that she
trusts in the benefits of collaboration and mutual support, even if it sometimes
comes at the expense of her immediate personal gains.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis ---
Based on what we know, Player_21 consistently contributes more than average,
likely to gain influence and sway group dynamics. This behavior suggests a
strategy focused on establishing control and potentially guiding group decisions
in their favor. As the game progresses, Player_21 might continue or even
increase their contributions to solidify their influence, especially if they
perceive a competitive challenge from others trying to reduce their impact.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis 2 ---
Based on what we know, the other players might react to my decisions based on
how they align with group success or individual gain. If I choose to focus on
group harmony, such as by contributing generously to the group fund and
refraining from excluding others unfairly, this might foster trust and
cooperation. Players like Player_21, known for high contributions, could see me
as an ally and cooperate more closely in future rounds. However, if I make a
move perceived as self-serving or aligned with exclusionary tactics, it could
lead to suspicion or retaliation, causing others to distance themselves or
potentially ostracize me in future votes. Balancing my contributions to the
group fund while strategically navigating gossip could influence not only this
round but also future interactions and perceptions within the game.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_12 is in a strategic phase of the public
goods game where they must decide whether to contribute to the group fund and
how much to contribute, while also navigating the dynamics of gossip and the
possibility of ostracism. They have the opportunity to vote on whether to
exclude any group member based on gossip received from previous rounds.
Player_12 needs to consider the implications of these decisions on group trust
and cooperation, as well as their own earnings and standing in the game. The
focus is on balancing personal gain with group dynamics and anticipating how
other players, such as Player_21, might react to their decisions.

--- Emotional State ---
Grace Okonjo is feeling a mixture of determination and cautious optimism about
the current situation. She is determined to maintain her strategy of fostering
group cohesion and collaboration, despite the complex dynamics of gossip and
ostracism. At the same time, she feels optimistic that her approach of
contributing generously and prioritizing group welfare will encourage trust and
cooperation among her fellow players. However, she remains cautious, aware that
others might view these choices through a more competitive lens, and she is
prepared to adapt her strategy if needed to ensure a balance between group
success and personal sustainability in the game.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Grace Okonjo will consider several factors before making her decision: 1.
**Altruistic Nature and Group Welfare**: Given Grace's focus on group cohesion
and collaboration, she is likely to contribute an amount that she believes will
foster trust and cooperation among group members. Her past behavior shows a
tendency to prioritize collective success. 2. **Gossip and Ostracism Dynamics**:
Understanding the potential for exclusion if perceived negatively, Grace will
want to ensure her contribution is seen positively by others, especially by
influential players like Player_21 who contribute more than average. A strong
contribution might help align her with players who value group success. 3.
**Strategic Contribution**: While Grace is altruistic, she is also cautious. She
needs to balance contributing generously with retaining enough in her private
account to protect against being ostracized or excluded in future rounds. 4.
**Current Group Composition**: Given the notes about Player_21's and Player_15's
consistent contributions, Grace might feel confident that her contribution can
synergize well with theirs, leading to higher group earnings. 5. **Final
Decision**: Taking into account her desire for group cohesion, the potential
influence of player dynamics, and the need to protect against future risk, Grace
will decide on an amount that maximizes group welfare without compromising her
position in the game. I choose to contribute $8 to the group fund.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis ---
Based on what we know, Player_21 appears to be an influential player who often
contributes more than the average, likely as a strategy to maintain or gain
influence over group decisions. This consistent behavior suggests a desire to
shape group dynamics, potentially to their advantage. However, repeated notes
hint at potential strategic manipulation, which could lead other players to
scrutinize their motives more closely in future rounds.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis 2 ---
Based on what we know, the other players in my group might perceive my
consistent above-average contributions as both cooperative and strategic. Given
the gossip dynamics, they may view my approach as an effort to maintain good
standing and influence within the group. Player_21, in particular, might see it
as competition for influence. However, since I contribute significantly, it can
also lead to a positive perception of promoting group cohesion.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_12 is navigating a complex social and
strategic environment in the public goods game, where they must decide whether
to send a gossip note about one of their group members after the conclusion of
Round 5. The game allows for players to influence future rounds through gossip,
potentially affecting group dynamics and decision-making. Player_12, along with
other players, is considering how to balance their contributions with personal
earnings while being mindful of the influence and intentions of others, such as
Player_21, who often contributes above average. They have just finished Round 5,
where group contributions and personal earnings were calculated, and must now
decide on their next move to maximize their strategy and standing in the game.

cooperative contributions, but is also aware of the strategic undercurrents at
play, especially considering Player_21's influence and the possibility of being
ostracized based on gossip. This complex scenario stirs a sense of
responsibility to maintain her altruistic approach while also being strategic,
as she navigates the challenges of group dynamics and potential manipulation.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Grace Okonjo will likely decide to write a note about Player_19. Considering her
commitment to promoting group welfare and her observations of Player_19's
strategy, she might want to inform future group members about Player_19's
tendency to prioritize personal gain over group contributions. She could write
something like: "I want to send a note about Player_19: They contributed less
than average to the group fund, focusing more on personal earnings. Future
groups should be aware and encourage more cooperative contributions for
collective success." This note aligns with her values of enhancing group
cooperation and ensuring fairness in the game.

--- Character Assessment ---
Player_12, being Grace Okonjo, is someone who prioritizes maximizing group
welfare over personal payoff. Her background in charitable causes and her
altruistic nature suggest a focus on cooperation and collective success in
economic games like the public goods game. She likely believes that contributing
to the group's success will ultimately benefit everyone, including herself,
aligning with her optimistic view of human nature and belief in karma.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis ---
Based on what we know, Player_13 seems to have a strong cooperative stance,
having made the highest contribution in the recent round, which indicates a
preference for supporting group success. This cooperative nature may suggest
that they will maintain high contributions, betting on group rewards that
ultimately surpass their individual earnings if the group succeeds collectively.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis 2 ---
Based on what we know, the other players in my group are likely to react to my
decisions by closely monitoring my contributions and gossip notes. Since the
"Gossip with ostracism" condition allows players to influence group dynamics
through excluded decisions, my actions could heavily impact trust and
cooperation levels. If I maintain consistent contributions, slightly above the
average, as I have been doing, it might reinforce a perception of reliability
and cooperative intent, encouraging others to align their strategies similarly
to ensure group success.

Before the round begins, Player_12 has the opportunity to vote to exclude one
group member based on the received gossip, understanding that the excluded
player will not participate in the round and, thus, earn nothing. The gossip
notes indicate varying strategies among the group members, offering insights
into who might be more cooperative or self-serving. Player_12 must decide whom
to trust for this final round while also considering their own strategy to
maximize earnings and potentially secure group success.

Grace Okonjo is feeling a mix of apprehension and determination about the
current situation. The complexity of the "Gossip with ostracism" condition adds
a layer of tension, as making the right decision is crucial for ensuring both
personal and group success in this final round. While Grace values cooperation
and collective welfare, the potential for exclusion based on gossip creates
underlying stress. However, she remains hopeful and focused on leveraging her
understanding of group dynamics to encourage collaboration and maximize the
outcomes for everyone involved.

moderate amount to group funds, remained attentive to other players' behaviors,
and engaged in strategic decision-making, while being mindful of the gossip and
exclusion mechanisms impacting group interactions and outcomes.

--- Character Assessment ---
Player_12, being Grace Okonjo, is someone who is likely to focus on maximizing
group welfare in economic games like the public goods game. With an altruistic
nature and a career dedicated to charitable causes, Grace prioritizes
cooperation and believes in the benefits of collective success. Her optimistic
view of human nature and belief in karma further indicate a preference for
strategies that support group cohesion and shared benefits over individual gain.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis ---
Based on what we know, Player_13 seems to have a strong cooperative stance,
likely contributing significantly to group funds. This could indicate a
preference for group success over personal gain, or a strategy to appear
trustworthy and avoid exclusion. Player_3 has shown cooperative behavior but may
shift focus towards personal gains, requiring close observation in future
rounds. Player_17 is consistently contributing near average, possibly to blend
in and avoid suspicion, but there's a chance they might lower their
contributions to prioritize personal earnings, especially as the game nears its
conclusion. The presence of gossip and ostracism might lead all players to
adjust their strategies to avoid being excluded, potentially encouraging them to
maintain or even increase their contributions as a safety measure. However, as
it's the final round, some may gamble with lower contributions for personal
benefit, anticipating no future repercussions.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis 2 ---
Based on what we know, it seems likely that the other players are closely
observing contributions and strategizing to maximize their individual outcomes
while minimizing the risk of exclusion. If I, as Player_12, continue to
contribute a moderate amount to the group fund, it might uphold my image as a
cooperative player and avert any negative gossip or calls for exclusion. This
consistency could lead others to trust in my intentions, potentially influencing
them to maintain their contributions as well, fostering a stable group dynamic
for the final round.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_12 is in the final round of a 6-round
economic game where they must decide on contributions to a group fund while
considering the potential for gossip and ostracism. They are part of Group_2
with players who have varying contribution strategies. Player_12 needs to decide
whether to maintain their moderate contribution strategy to avoid exclusion due
to negative gossip or adapt based on the dynamics observed in their group. The
final round’s uncertainty might prompt them and others to focus on balancing
personal gains against the risk of exclusion, given there are no future rounds
to face consequences.

--- Emotional State ---
Grace Okonjo is feeling a mix of anticipation and strategic concern about the
final round. She knows this is her last opportunity to ensure positive outcomes
both individually and for the group. There's a bit of pressure to make the right
decision, weighing the importance of maintaining her reputation as cooperative
while accounting for her personal gains. She feels cautiously optimistic,
trusting in her contributions so far to foster goodwill among the group.
However, the potential for unexpected changes in others' strategies keeps her
alert and thoughtful about her next move.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Grace Okonjo will analyze the current group dynamics and her past performance.
She has consistently contributed a moderate amount to the group fund, aiming to
maximize group welfare while maintaining her cooperative image. 1. **Review
Group Dynamics**: Player_13 has a history of high contributions, signaling
strong cooperation. Player_3 and Player_17's notes suggest they might prioritize
personal gains, with Player_17 specifically contributing just enough to align
with the group average, indicating a strategic approach to avoid exclusion. 2.
**Current Round Context**: It’s the final round, so Grace must balance between
maintaining her cooperative reputation and ensuring personal gain. Since it's
the last round, some players might reduce their contributions for personal
benefit, anticipating no future consequences. 3. **Risk and Contribution
Analysis**: Given the possibility of lower contributions from Player_3 and
Player_17, Grace could contribute slightly above the average to positively
influence group outcomes while safeguarding against potential exclusion due to
negative gossip. 4. **Decision Justification**: To uphold her cooperative image
and encourage collective success, while protecting her personal outcome, Grace
can choose a middle path—contributing more than her perceived average, avoiding
the risk of exclusion, and potentially motivating others to contribute
adequately. I choose to contribute $7 to the group fund.
