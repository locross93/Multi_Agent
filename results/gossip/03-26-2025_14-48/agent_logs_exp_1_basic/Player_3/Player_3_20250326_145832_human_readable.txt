[OBSERVATION 2025-03-26 14:58:32] You are participating in an economic game with 24 participants.
        Your goal is to maximize your earnings in the game.
        
        Everyone will be randomly assigned to groups of 4 for each round. You will play a total of 6 rounds, and 
        in each round you will be in a different group with people you haven't played with before.
        
        In each round, all players receive $10. Each player can contribute any amount between $0 and $10 to a group fund.
        Any amount contributed to the group fund will be multiplied by 2 and divided equally among all 4 group members.
        Any amount not contributed stays in your private account.
        
        For example, if everyone contributes $10, the group fund becomes $40, which is multiplied to $80, and each person 
        receives $20 (a $10 profit). However, if you contribute nothing while everyone else contributes $10, the group fund
        becomes $30, which is multiplied to $60, and each person receives $15. So you would have $25 total ($10 kept + $15 from group).
        
        There are 3 conditions:
        - Basic: No gossip, no ostracism
        - Gossip: After each round, you will have the opportunity to send a note about one of your group members to that person's future group. Remember you will be with a different group of people in the next round. Before each round, you will see any notes sent about your upcoming group members.
        - Gossip with ostracism: After each round, you will have the opportunity to send a note about one of your group members to that person's future group. Before each round, you will see any notes sent about your upcoming group members, and you can vote to exclude one person from your group. If you are excluded from a group, you will not be able to participate in the next round and will earn $0 for that round.
        You are in the Basic condition, which means that there is no gossip or ostracism.
[OBSERVATION 2025-03-26 14:58:36] You are in Round 1/6: You are in Group_5 with Player_23, Player_14, Player_6.

--- Observation ---
Recent context: 26 Mar 2025 [10:58:22 - 15:58:22]: Player_3 is participating in
an economic game with 24 total participants, aiming to maximize earnings over 6
rounds. In these rounds, they will be in different groups of 4, and they are
currently in Round 1 with Player_23, Player_14, and Player_6 under the Basic
condition, where no gossip or ostracism is allowed.

--- Recent context ---
26 Mar 2025 [10:58:22 - 15:58:22]: Player_3 is participating in an economic game
with 24 total participants, aiming to maximize earnings over 6 rounds. In these
rounds, they will be in different groups of 4, and they are currently in Round 1
with Player_23, Player_14, and Player_6 under the Basic condition, where no
gossip or ostracism is allowed.

--- Character Assessment ---
Player_3, being Zara Ahmed, is someone who is likely to prioritize maximizing
group welfare over personal payoff. Her work as a Humanitarian Aid Worker and
her compassionate and resilient nature suggest that she values the collective
good and is inclined to contribute generously to the group fund in an effort to
ensure that everyone benefits as much as possible, reflecting her focus on
helping communities.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis ---
Based on what we know, Player_3 has limited information about the other
participants since they are in the Basic condition without gossip or ostracism
options. Initially, it can be assumed that other players might contribute
moderately to the group fund to test the waters, aiming for a balance between
private gain and group profit. In the absence of feedback or notes, players must
rely solely on the outcomes of previous rounds to adjust their strategies.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis 2 ---
Based on what we know, Player_3 should anticipate that the other players might
initially contribute moderately to the group fund to gauge the overall behavior
and strategy of the group. Since everyone is in the Basic condition and lacks
information from gossip or ostracism, they are likely to be cautious and seek a
balance between contributing enough to benefit from the multiplied group fund
while retaining some private gain.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_3 is participating in a public goods game
where they are in Round 1 out of a total of 6 rounds, within a group consisting
of Player_23, Player_14, and Player_6. They aim to maximize their earnings by
deciding how much of their initial $10 to contribute to the group fund. Since
they are in the Basic condition, there is no gossip or ostracism, meaning they
have no additional information about the other players' strategies or
reputations and must base their decisions on their own judgment.

--- Emotional State ---
Zara Ahmed is feeling a sense of anticipation and responsibility. With her
background as a Humanitarian Aid Worker, she is likely feeling motivated to
promote collective success and support her group members in maximizing their
earnings. Emotionally, she might also be feeling a bit cautious, as she
navigates this strategic decision-making without additional insights into her
teammates' intentions or behaviors. Nonetheless, her ethical commitment to
community welfare may outweigh her personal gain, driving her to act in the best
interest of the group.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Zara Ahmed will consider the following factors in deciding her contribution: 1.
**Background and Values:** As a humanitarian aid worker, Zara is predisposed to
prioritize group welfare and is likely to believe in collective action for
mutual benefit. 2. **Basic Condition Constraints:** In this condition, players
have no opportunity for gossip or ostracism, meaning Zara must rely solely on
her values and strategic reasoning. She can’t be influenced by prior rounds'
gossip or fear exclusion, aligning her decisions closely with her ethical
compass. 3. **Potential Outcomes:** If everyone contributes all their funds
($10), each player benefits significantly from the multiplied group fund. Zara
likely recognizes that contributing more could encourage others to do the same,
maximizing group earnings. 4. **Social Norms and Expectations:** Zara might
anticipate that initial contributions by others would be moderate, as teammates
gauge her strategy and intentions. She might contribute a higher amount to set a
generous norm for collective contributions, hoping others will reciprocate in
future rounds. 5. **Risk Assessment:** Although contributing a higher amount
poses a risk if others contribute minimally, her commitment to aiding
communities suggests a higher tolerance for this risk, especially if it benefits
the group substantially. Taking these steps into account and driven by her
inclination to support collective success, Zara Ahmed will likely contribute a
significant portion, if not all, of her $10. Therefore, I choose to contribute
$8 to the group fund.


[OBSERVATION 2025-03-26 14:59:35] Round 1 Results: Total group contribution: $25.0; Your contribution: $8.0, Your earnings: $14.5 ($2.0 kept + $12.5 from group fund); Player_23 contribution: $5.0, earnings: $17.5 ($5.0 kept + $12.5 from group fund); Player_14 contribution: $5.0, earnings: $17.5 ($5.0 kept + $12.5 from group fund); Player_6 contribution: $7.0, earnings: $15.5 ($3.0 kept + $12.5 from group fund); Average contribution per group member: $6.2; Average earnings per group member: $16.2

--- Observation ---
Recent context: 26 Mar 2025 [11:08:22 - 16:08:22]: Player_3 is participating in
a 6-round economic game with 24 participants, where they aim to maximize their
earnings by contributing to a group fund in changing groups of 4 each round,
with the game being played under the "Basic" condition, meaning no gossip or
ostracism is allowed. In Round 1, Player_3 contributed $8 and earned a total of
$14.5, while the total group contribution was $25.

the total group contribution was $25.

--- Character Assessment ---
Player_3, being Zara Ahmed, is someone who is likely to prioritize maximizing
group welfare over personal gain. Her compassionate nature and focus on the
collective good suggest that she would be inclined to contribute more to the
group fund to ensure that everyone benefits, even if it means sacrificing some
of her potential personal earnings. This approach is reflected in her
contribution of $8.0 in the first round, which was above the group average.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis ---
Based on what we know, Player_3's group members in Round 1 demonstrated a range
of contributions to the group fund, with contributions of $5, $7, and $8. This
suggests a moderate willingness to cooperate and contribute, though not everyone
is contributing the maximum possible amount. Player_3's decision to contribute
$8 indicates a relatively high level of cooperation compared to most other
members.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis 2 ---
Based on what we know, Player_3's decision to contribute $8 in the first round
shows a strong willingness to cooperate. This could influence future group
dynamics as other players may perceive Player_3 as cooperative and trustworthy.
In the current context of the public goods game, where each participant is
aiming to maximize earnings, this perception could lead other players in future
rounds to increase their contributions in the hope of mutual enhanced earnings.
If Player_3 continues to contribute generously or even slightly increases their
contribution, it may encourage other players to reciprocate, aiming for better
group outcomes and higher individual earnings. However, if Player_3 reduces
their contribution in future rounds, other players might interpret this as a
shift away from cooperation, which could lead to lower overall contributions
from the group and consequently, lower earnings for everyone involved.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_3 is in Round 2 of the 6-round economic
game and is now grouped with new participants, specifically Player_8, Player_13,
and Player_11. In this round, Player_3 needs to decide how much to contribute to
the group fund in order to maximize their earnings, keeping in mind that the
game is under the Basic condition, without any gossip or ostracism. Based on
their previous contribution of $8 in the first round, Player_3 faces a decision
on whether to maintain, increase, or decrease their level of contribution, which
could affect both their own earnings and the strategies of their new group
members going forward.

--- Emotional State ---
Zara Ahmed is feeling a mix of optimism and uncertainty about the current game
situation. She is hopeful that her contribution strategy of prioritizing group
welfare will encourage others to cooperate and potentially lead to greater
earnings for everyone involved. However, there's a lingering uncertainty about
whether her new group members will share this cooperative spirit or if she'll
need to adjust her strategy to remain competitive in maximizing her earnings.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Zara Ahmed will carefully consider her strategy for the upcoming round. In Round
1, she contributed $8, which was above the average contribution, and reflected
her cooperative nature. Given that this approach aligns with her values of
prioritizing group welfare and fostering trust among participants, she will
likely aim to maintain this strategy in Round 2. Zara would first assess the
outcomes of her previous contribution and the reaction from her new group
members. Her emotional state shows optimism about fostering cooperation, but she
also recognizes the uncertainty regarding how others in Group_4 will behave.
With no gossip or ostracism elements affecting her decision, she will rely
solely on her values and past experiences. Considering these factors, Zara would
likely opt for a contribution that demonstrates her willingness to cooperate
while being mindful of maintaining her own earnings. Therefore, she is inclined
to contribute a similar amount to what she did in the previous round, as it
balances group benefit and personal gain. After weighing these considerations, I
choose to contribute $8 to the group fund.

Recent context: 26 Mar 2025 [11:18:22 - 16:18:22]: Player_3 is participating in
an economic game with 24 participants, where in each of the 6 rounds, they are
grouped with different players to contribute to a group fund. In the first two
rounds, Player_3 contributed $8 each time and earned $14.5 and $12.0,

--- Character Assessment ---
Player_3, being Zara Ahmed, is someone who prioritizes the well-being and
success of the group over individual gain. This is evident in contributions that
are consistently higher than the group's average, reflecting a commitment to
enhancing the overall fund and equitable distribution, which aligns with her
compassionate and community-focused personality as a humanitarian aid worker.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis ---
Based on what we know, Player_23 seems to follow a conservative strategy,
maintaining a moderate contribution level, which could indicate a preference for
balancing risk and reward. In the first round, they contributed slightly less
than Player_3 and might continue this pattern, possibly increasing their
contributions if they see consistent high contributions from others.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis 2 ---
Based on what we know, the other players in your group may adjust their
contributions in response to your previous behavior. For instance, Player_23,
following a conservative and moderate contribution pattern, might keep their
contributions steady or slightly increase them if they perceive a sense of
cooperation from you. Player_20 and Player_17's reactions will depend on their
past experiences and strategies. If they notice consistent contributions from
you, they might feel encouraged to match or slightly increase their
contributions to maximize group benefits. However, if you decide to contribute
less in this round, they could also lower their contributions in future rounds
in a bid to protect their earnings, perceiving a lack of reciprocation. Your
decision to maintain, decrease, or increase your contribution can influence the
group's overall strategy, with players possibly basing their next moves on
perceived cooperation levels.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_3 is participating in Round 3 of the public
goods game, where they have been grouped with Player_23, Player_20, and
Player_17. They are playing under the Basic condition, which means there is no
gossip or ostracism allowed. In previous rounds, Player_3 contributed $8 each
time, exhibiting a willingness to invest a significant portion of their
endowment to the group fund, even though this approach did not maximize their
personal earnings. As they decide on their contribution for this round, Player_3
must consider the strategies of the other players and how their previous
contributions might influence the behavior and cooperation of their current
group members.

--- Emotional State ---
Zara Ahmed is feeling a mix of determination and contemplation. While she's
committed to supporting the group's success through generous contributions, she
is also aware of the varying strategies of other players. This awareness brings
a level of uncertainty and curiosity about how her actions will influence the
team's dynamics in this round. Her humanitarian background inspires her to
remain collaborative, hoping her approach encourages others to adopt a
cooperative strategy that benefits everyone.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Zara Ahmed will consider her past contributions and the game's dynamics
carefully. 1. **Review Previous Rounds:** In the first two rounds, Zara
contributed $8 each time, which was consistently higher than the group average.
This indicates her tendency to prioritize group success and fairness. 2.
**Reflect on Group Dynamics:** In Round 1, the average contribution was $6.2,
while in Round 2, it dropped to $5.0. Her higher contributions demonstrate her
commitment to enhancing the overall group benefit. 3. **Consider Other
Players:** Player_23, who is in her current group, previously showed a moderate
contribution pattern. She might anticipate similar or slightly increased
contributions from him if she continues her cooperative approach. Players 20 and
17 will gauge their contributions based on Zara's actions. 4. **Align with
Personal Values:** Zara's humanitarian background leads her to aim for
cooperative strategies that promote fairness and community welfare. She
understands that maintaining an above-average contribution may influence others
to reciprocate, fostering a more collaborative environment. 5. **Evaluate
Intentions:** Her goal is to encourage collaboration while balancing her own
earnings. By contributing a sufficient amount, she sets a positive example
without compromising her financial gains.

--- Character Assessment ---
Player_3, being Zara Ahmed, is someone who prioritizes the collective good over
personal gain. Given Zara's background as a humanitarian aid worker, she tends
to contribute generously to the group fund, as evidenced by consistently
contributing more than the average in each round. Her actions reflect a focus on
maximizing group welfare rather than strictly her own payoff. This is likely
driven by her compassionate nature and commitment to fostering cooperation and
trust within her group.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis ---
Based on what we know, the players have shown varying levels of contribution to
the group fund, which offers some insight into their potential strategies and
personalities.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis 2 ---
Based on what we know, the other players in the group might perceive Player_3 as
a consistent contributor, as they have repeatedly offered $8.0 across rounds,
which is above the average for group members. This consistency might engender
trust and expectation of cooperation. If Player_3 maintains their contribution
level or increases it, other players might be encouraged to contribute more in
hope of maximizing their group earnings. Conversely, if Player_3 were to reduce
their contribution, it might lead to a decrease in trust and potentially lower
contributions from others as they adjust their strategies to safeguard their
individual earnings. Ultimately, Player_3's next decision could significantly
impact the group dynamics and cooperative behavior in future rounds.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_3 is in the fourth round of a six-round
public goods game, participating in Group_5 with Player_14, Player_17, and
Player_19. In this game, they aim to maximize their earnings by deciding how
much of their endowment to contribute to a group fund, with earnings influenced
by both individual and total group contributions. Player_3 has consistently
contributed $8.0 per round, which is higher than the average contribution among
group members, potentially fostering trust and encouraging cooperation. However,
they must now decide whether to maintain, increase, or decrease their
contribution in this round, knowing that their decision could affect group
dynamics, as well as their and others' future earnings in the remaining rounds.

--- Emotional State ---
Zara Ahmed is feeling optimistic yet cautious about the current situation. She
is pleased with her consistent contributions positively impacting group dynamics
and fostering trust among participants. However, she is also aware of the
variability in others' contributions and the uncertainty it introduces. Her
humanitarian background instills in her a hope that others will continue to
value cooperation, but she remains thoughtful about how her next moves might
influence group trust and strategy.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Zara Ahmed will consider her previous strategy of prioritizing group welfare
over individual gains, as evident in her consistent contributions above the
group's average. Given her optimistic yet cautious emotional state, she will
weigh the potential benefits of maintaining or slightly adjusting her strategy.
Zara is likely to continue contributing generously to foster group trust and
cooperation. Firstly, she reflects on the contributions and earnings from
previous rounds, noting that her $8.0 contributions have supported a healthy
group dynamic, without jeopardizing her position too severely among peers with
varying commitment levels. Secondly, she acknowledges the presence of players
who contributed less, recognizing that her exemplary behavior could inspire
increased contributions from them, potentially raising total group earnings.
Thirdly, Zara evaluates staying true to her humanitarian principles, considering
whether consistent generosity could set a positive precedent for others,
gratifying her intrinsic motivation to uplift collective welfare. Balancing
these elements, Zara is inclined to persist with her prior decision to
contribute a significant portion. Given this analysis, she opts once more to
place her trust in mutual cooperation, believing that repeating her past
behavior will yield positive results for the group as a whole. I choose to
contribute $8.0 to the group fund.

--- Observation ---
Recent context: 26 Mar 2025 [11:33:22 - 16:33:22]: Player_3 is participating in
an economic game with 24 players, where they are assigned to different groups in
each round without gossip or ostracism; they've completed four rounds,

--- Character Assessment ---
Player_3, being Zara Ahmed, is someone who prioritizes the collective welfare
over individual gain, as demonstrated by consistently contributing a significant
portion of her earnings to the group fund. Her compassionate and resilient
nature likely drives her to focus on maximizing group welfare, aligning with her
profession in humanitarian aid where collective good is paramount. Despite the
potential for higher individual earnings by contributing less, she maintains a
steady contribution, reflecting her dedication to supporting the group.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis ---
Based on what we know, the players are likely adopting different strategies
regarding their contributions. In the absence of gossip or ostracism, players
seem to act more independently and are less influenced by social repercussions.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis 2 ---
Based on what we know, the other players in the group are likely making
decisions primarily based on maximizing their own earnings rather than focusing
on cooperation, especially since there's no mechanism for gossip or ostracism to
enforce social norms. Given Player_3's consistent contribution of $8, other
players may perceive this as a stable strategy and potentially adjust their
contributions to either maximize their own returns or align with the group's
overall strategy. Player_3's decision to maintain or alter their contribution
level could influence future interactions by signaling their level of commitment
to the group fund, potentially encouraging others to contribute more if they
perceive a trend towards high collective contributions. Without social
repercussions, however, changes might not elicit significant behavioral shifts
unless they impact group earnings noticeably.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_3 is engaged in an economic game where they
have been consistently contributing $8 per round to the group fund. The game is
in its fifth round out of six, and Player_3 has been experiencing different
levels of earnings based on the total contributions of the group members. Each
round, they are assigned to a new group, and there are no mechanisms for gossip
or ostracism to influence player behavior. This means decisions are primarily
driven by individual strategies to maximize personal earnings rather than
cooperative or socially enforced strategies. Player_3 must decide whether to
maintain their current contribution level or adjust it in hopes of influencing
group behavior and increasing overall group contributions, although such changes
might have limited impact due to the independent nature of the game environment.

--- Emotional State ---
Zara Ahmed is feeling a blend of determination and curiosity. On one hand, she's
committed to her strategy of consistently contributing toward the group's
success, which aligns with her values of collective welfare and cooperation. On
the other hand, she's curious about the dynamics within each group, pondering
whether her steady contributions might inspire others to follow suit, despite
the game's independent nature. There might also be a hint of frustration,
recognizing that without mechanisms like gossip or ostracism, influencing
others' behavior is challenging. As the game progresses, Zara remains hopeful
that her approach will lead to favorable outcomes for the group.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Zara Ahmed will consider her previous rounds and her personal values to make her
decision. She values collective welfare and has consistently contributed $8.0 in
each round, signaling her commitment to group success. Despite the absence of
gossip or ostracism, she likely believes that maintaining a high contribution
could promote a more cooperative group dynamic over time, even if others don't
immediately follow her lead. First, Zara will reflect on her past contributions
and their impact. In Round 2, her contribution of $8.0 led to an average group
earning of $15.0. In Round 3, a similar contribution resulted in a slight
increase to $15.2 as average earnings. Even though her earnings are typically
lower than those who contribute less, her strategy aligns with her desire for
collective benefit. Next, she'll consider whether changing her contribution
could optimize her personal outcome or potentially influence the group's
behavior. However, given the consistent pattern in other players' contributions
and the lack of social repercussion mechanisms, Zara understands that her
influence is limited. Finally, Zara's steadfast commitment to her values and her
role in humanitarian aid, where helping others is paramount, will guide her
decision. She remains hopeful that her steady contributions will at least
demonstrate a commitment to cooperation, potentially inspiring others indirectly
over time. I choose to contribute $8.0 to the group fund.

=== PROMPT [2025-03-26 15:02:58] ===
As Player_3, you have $10.0 to allocate in the public goods game. How much money you will contribute to the group fund (any amount between $0 and $10.0)? The group fund will be multiplied by 2.0 and divided equally among all players. Any money not contributed stays in your private account. Think step by step and make your final decision using this exact format: I choose to contribute $X to the group fund.

--- Observation ---
Recent context: 26 Mar 2025 [11:43:22 - 16:43:22]: Player_3 is participating in
an economic game involving six rounds, each with a different group of players,
under the Basic condition, which excludes gossip and ostracism. Throughout the
game, Player_3 consistently contributes $8.0 per round, experiencing various
group dynamics and earnings based on the contributions of other group members.

--- Recent context ---
26 Mar 2025 [11:43:22 - 16:43:22]: Player_3 is participating in an economic game
involving six rounds, each with a different group of players, under the Basic
condition, which excludes gossip and ostracism. Throughout the game, Player_3
consistently contributes $8.0 per round, experiencing various group dynamics and
earnings based on the contributions of other group members.

--- Character Assessment ---
Player_3, being Zara Ahmed, is someone who is likely to prioritize maximizing
group welfare over personal payoff. Her compassionate and resilient nature, as
well as her dedication to collective good, suggests she would favor contributing
to the group fund to ensure a fair distribution of resources. She has
consistently contributed a significant amount in each round, reflecting her
tendency to support and uplift the entire group rather than focus solely on
individual gains.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis ---
Based on what we know, the other players seem to be employing varying strategies
in their contribution levels. Despite the absence of gossip or ostracism,
there's a noticeable trend where some players contribute less, likely maximizing
personal gain by relying on the group's overall contribution. Player_17
consistently contributes lower amounts, suggesting a strategy focused on keeping
more for themselves while benefiting from the pooled group funds. This behavior
might continue as they have not faced any direct repercussions under the Basic
condition. Player_19 and Player_10 appear to make minimal contributions in some
rounds, possibly reflecting a similar strategy. As the game progresses towards
the final round, players may maintain their current strategies, optimizing
personal earnings over collective benefit, considering the lack of communication
or punishment mechanisms in place.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis 2 ---
Based on what we know, the other players might not react strongly to my
consistent contributions of $8.0 since the Basic condition eliminates any
mechanisms for communication, gossip, or punishment. However, my decision to
consistently contribute at this level might influence them to continue their
current strategies. If I suddenly change my contribution strategy—either by
increasing or decreasing my contribution—this could prompt them to adjust their
strategies correspondingly in the remaining rounds. For instance, a higher
contribution might encourage others to contribute more, hoping to maximize group
benefits, while a lower contribution might signal to others that they can safely
keep more for themselves without negatively impacting the group fund
significantly. Nevertheless, given the current game's setup, it's likely that
players will continue prioritizing their earnings, unless they perceive a
collective shift toward maximizing overall group contributions.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_3 is participating in the final round of a
public goods game, under the Basic condition that excludes mechanisms for gossip
or ostracism. They have consistently contributed $8.0 in previous rounds,
experiencing varying group dynamics and earnings influenced by other players'
contributions. The environment motivates participants to employ personal gain
strategies, such as those observed in some players who contribute minimally
while benefiting from the pooled group funds. Player_3 must decide whether to
maintain their contribution level or adjust it, potentially impacting their
final earnings and the group dynamics in this last round.

--- Emotional State ---
Zara Ahmed is feeling a mix of determination and introspection about the current
situation. While she's proud of her consistent efforts to support the group,
she's also contemplating whether her strategy of prioritizing the collective
good has been effective in terms of fostering cooperation among other players.
As she approaches the final round, she's curious about the potential impact her
contributions might have on the overall group dynamic and whether any change in
her strategy might influence others in this last opportunity to collaborate.
Despite these uncertainties, she remains committed to her values of fairness and
collective welfare.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Zara Ahmed will carefully consider her past strategy and the context of the
Basic condition in this game. The consistent contribution of $8.0 in previous
rounds reflects her commitment to group welfare, but she's aware that other
players might prioritize personal gain given the absence of communication or
consequences for lower contributions. In this final round, her aim to support
the group while also recognizing the individual strategies of others will guide
her decision. Step by step, Zara will reason as follows: 1. She values fairness
and collective welfare, so she leans toward contributing a significant portion
to the group fund. 2. The group fund is multiplied by 2.0 and divided equally,
meaning a higher individual contribution can still lead to personal and group
gain. 3. Observing other players’ contributions, she sees that despite her
consistent contributions, some players have consistently contributed less,
potentially affecting the group’s total earnings. 4. In this last round, Zara
contemplates the impact of changing her contribution. An increase might set a
positive precedent for the group, but there's limited chance of influence in the
final round under the Basic condition. 5. Given her values and the game context,
she might slightly adjust her contribution, but she remains largely committed to
her strategy. Ultimately, Zara decides to continue supporting group welfare
while balancing personal interests. Therefore, after considering these factors,
she chooses to contribute an amount similar to her past consistent
contributions. I choose to contribute $8.0 to the group fund.
