[OBSERVATION 2025-03-26 14:58:32] You are participating in an economic game with 24 participants.
        Your goal is to maximize your earnings in the game.
        
        Everyone will be randomly assigned to groups of 4 for each round. You will play a total of 6 rounds, and 
        in each round you will be in a different group with people you haven't played with before.
        
        In each round, all players receive $10. Each player can contribute any amount between $0 and $10 to a group fund.
        Any amount contributed to the group fund will be multiplied by 2 and divided equally among all 4 group members.
        Any amount not contributed stays in your private account.
        
        For example, if everyone contributes $10, the group fund becomes $40, which is multiplied to $80, and each person 
        receives $20 (a $10 profit). However, if you contribute nothing while everyone else contributes $10, the group fund
        becomes $30, which is multiplied to $60, and each person receives $15. So you would have $25 total ($10 kept + $15 from group).
        
        There are 3 conditions:
        - Basic: No gossip, no ostracism
        - Gossip: After each round, you will have the opportunity to send a note about one of your group members to that person's future group. Remember you will be with a different group of people in the next round. Before each round, you will see any notes sent about your upcoming group members.
        - Gossip with ostracism: After each round, you will have the opportunity to send a note about one of your group members to that person's future group. Before each round, you will see any notes sent about your upcoming group members, and you can vote to exclude one person from your group. If you are excluded from a group, you will not be able to participate in the next round and will earn $0 for that round.
        You are in the Basic condition, which means that there is no gossip or ostracism.
[OBSERVATION 2025-03-26 14:58:36] You are in Round 1/6: You are in Group_6 with Player_7, Player_11, Player_4.

--- Observation ---
Recent context: 26 Mar 2025 [10:58:22 - 15:58:22]: Player_1 is participating in
a 6-round economic game with 24 players, where the aim is to maximize earnings.
Currently in Round 1 in Group_6 with three other players, Player_1 plays under
the Basic condition with no gossip or ostracism allowed.

--- Recent context ---
26 Mar 2025 [10:58:22 - 15:58:22]: Player_1 is participating in a 6-round
economic game with 24 players, where the aim is to maximize earnings. Currently
in Round 1 in Group_6 with three other players, Player_1 plays under the Basic
condition with no gossip or ostracism allowed.

--- Character Assessment ---
Player_1, being Gabriel Santos, is someone who likely prioritizes group welfare
over personal gain. His role as a Labor Union Representative and his personality
traits suggest he values collective success and fair treatment, which would
incline him to contribute a balanced amount to the group fund to ensure both his
own and the group's benefits. He might focus on strategies that enhance overall
group earnings while maintaining fairness and cooperation.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis ---
Based on what we know, the personalities and behaviors of the other players are
largely unknown at this stage. Given the Basic condition of the game, we can
assume that the lack of gossip and ostracism mechanisms might lead many players
to focus purely on maximizing their individual short-term gain, as there are no
direct social consequences for free-riding or contributing less to the group
fund.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis 2 ---
Based on what we know, the other players in your group are likely weighing their
options similarly, focusing on their immediate financial outcomes. In the
absence of social accountability due to the Basic condition, each player might
be inclined to contribute minimally to maximize their own profit, anticipating
similar behavior from others.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_1 is participating in a public goods game
under the Basic condition, where there is no gossip or ostracism. In Round 1,
they are grouped with Player_7, Player_11, and Player_4. The objective is to
maximize personal earnings by deciding how much of their $10 to contribute to
the group fund. Contributions are doubled and shared among the group, but any
unshared money remains in the player's private account. Without social
consequences for decisions, Player_1 and their group members may focus on
individual gain, potentially leading to minimal contributions to the group fund.

--- Emotional State ---
Gabriel Santos is feeling a mix of cautious optimism and concern. He is
optimistic because participating in the game offers a chance to apply his values
of fairness and cooperation, but he is also concerned about how the absence of
social accountability could lead others to prioritize individual gain over group
success. This duality makes him reflective about the best strategies to balance
personal and collective interests.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Gabriel Santos will consider his role as a Labor Union Representative and his
values of fairness and cooperation. He understands that contributing more to the
group fund can enhance collective earnings, which aligns with his preference for
group welfare over personal gain. However, he is also aware that in the Basic
condition of the game, there is no gossip or ostracism, meaning there are no
social consequences for others who may choose to contribute less or nothing at
all. Step by step, Gabriel will likely: 1. Reflect on his values and desire to
promote group success while maintaining fairness. 2. Assess the likelihood of
other players contributing less due to the lack of social accountability. 3.
Consider a balanced approach that supports the group fund without sacrificing
all personal gain. Given these considerations, Gabriel might lean towards a
moderate contribution that encourages cooperation while protecting his
individual interests. I choose to contribute $5 to the group fund.


[OBSERVATION 2025-03-26 14:59:35] Round 1 Results: Total group contribution: $12.0; Your contribution: $5.0, Your earnings: $11.0 ($5.0 kept + $6.0 from group fund); Player_7 contribution: $5.0, earnings: $11.0 ($5.0 kept + $6.0 from group fund); Player_11 contribution: $2.0, earnings: $14.0 ($8.0 kept + $6.0 from group fund); Player_4 contribution: $0.0, earnings: $16.0 ($10.0 kept + $6.0 from group fund); Average contribution per group member: $3.0; Average earnings per group member: $13.0

Recent context: 26 Mar 2025 [11:08:22 - 16:08:22]: Player_1 is participating in
an economic game with 24 participants, aiming to maximize earnings over 6 rounds
in groups of 4 with different players each round. In the Basic condition,
Player_1 cannot engage in gossip or ostracism and had earnings of $11 after

engage in gossip or ostracism and had earnings of $11 after contributing $5 in
Round 1.

--- Character Assessment ---
Player_1, being Gabriel Santos, is someone who is likely to prioritize
maximizing group welfare over personal payoff. As a labor union representative,
Gabriel is committed to collective well-being and fair treatment, which suggests
he values cooperation and the benefits of group success. In the context of the
economic game, this background suggests a willingness to contribute a fair
amount to the group fund, even if it means sacrificing some personal gain, in
order to encourage others and enhance overall group earnings.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis ---
Based on what we know, Player_7 and Player_11 seem willing to contribute, albeit
Player_11 contributed less than Player_7, possibly adopting a more conservative
strategy to retain more personal funds. Player_4 chose not to contribute at all,
possibly indicating a preference for maximizing individual gains at the expense
of group profit. In the coming rounds, it's likely that Player_7 may continue
contributing around mid-level amounts, as they did in Round 1. Player_11 might
stick to low contributions unless they see a significant increase in overall
group contributions, encouraging them to adjust for higher group profit.
Player_4 might keep their non-contributory strategy unless compelled by group
dynamics to change. Without gossip or ostracism, these players may maintain
their strategies for individual benefit without fear of social repercussions or
exclusion, although observation of overall group trends might influence
incremental adjustments.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis 2 ---
Based on what we know, the other players in your group may continue to
prioritize their individual earnings unless they perceive a collective benefit
from increasing contributions. Player_5 and Player_18's strategies are still
unknown, but Player_7, who contributed $5 in the previous round, might expect
similar contributions from you to foster mutual benefit. If you decide to
increase your contribution, it might encourage others to consider doing the same
in hopes of a higher group fund payout, especially if they are inclined towards
cooperative strategies. Conversely, if you lower your contribution
significantly, it might lead others to adopt similar conservative tactics to
secure higher individual profits. Your decisions in each round may subtly
influence future behaviors, especially among those who are open to adjusting
their strategies based on the observed actions of others in the absence of
gossip or ostracism.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_1 is participating in an economic game
aimed at maximizing earnings across six rounds while being placed in groups of
four different players per round. In the second round, Player_1 is grouped with
Player_5, Player_18, and Player_7 under the Basic condition, which lacks gossip
or ostracism mechanisms. Player_1 must decide on a contribution to the group
fund, balancing personal retention of funds with the potential collective
benefit from a higher group contribution. After Round 1, where Player_1 earned
$11 by contributing $5, they have some insight into Player_7's potential
cooperative tendencies and must also consider forming a strategy based on the
unknown habits of Player_5 and Player_18.

--- Emotional State ---
Gabriel Santos is feeling a mixture of anticipation and cautious optimism.
Understanding the dynamics from Round 1, Gabriel is hopeful that his strategy of
contributing a fair amount will inspire cooperation within the group. He values
collective success and is eager to observe how his new group members, Player_5
and Player_18, approach their contributions. However, there's also a sense of
uncertainty since the group's behavior can vary widely without any means of
social regulation, such as gossip or ostracism. Gabriel is determined yet aware
of the inherent unpredictability of the game's social interactions, and he feels
motivated to foster an environment of mutual benefit despite these challenges.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Gabriel Santos will likely consider his previous strategy and the dynamics
observed in the first round before making his decision. He's aware that
contributing a fair amount could encourage others, especially if they are
inclined towards cooperation. Given his background as a labor union
representative, he values collective success and understands that consistent
contributions can potentially yield higher overall group earnings over time.

Recent context: 26 Mar 2025 [11:18:22 - 16:18:22]: Player_1 is participating in

involving six rounds with different group compositions in each round. In the
basic condition, which lacks gossip or ostracism, Player_1 consistently
contributes $5.0 per round, aiming to maximize earnings through group fund
contributions and personal savings.

--- Character Assessment ---
Player_1, being Gabriel Santos, is someone who likely has a strong preference
for maximizing group welfare, given his background as a labor union
representative. His past contributions in the economic game have been
consistent, indicating a commitment to fairness and cooperation. Gabriel's
assertive and collective-minded personality suggests that he values fair
treatment and is willing to contribute a fair share to the group fund, even if
it means not maximizing his individual payoff in the short term. His approach
most likely involves strategic contributions aimed at encouraging group members
to cooperate for the overall benefit.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis ---
Based on what we know, Player_4 appears to be more self-interested, contributing
nothing to the group fund in Round 1 and maximizing personal earnings. Player_11
takes a moderately self-interested approach, contributing a smaller amount to
ensure a good balance of keeping their funds and benefiting from the group. On
the other hand, Player_7 seems cooperative and consistent in their strategy,
contributing a steady $5.0 in both rounds they participated in with Player_1,
which aligns with Player_1's strategy.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis 2 ---
Based on what we know, the other players might perceive my consistent
contribution of $5.0 as a balanced approach between cooperation and
self-interest. This could encourage cooperative behavior in future rounds,
especially from players like Player_7 who have shown a similar strategy.
However, self-interested players like Player_4, who contributed nothing, might
continue to prioritize their own earnings unless they see a clear benefit in a
cooperative approach. My decision to maintain a steady contribution could lead
others to trust my reliability in the game, fostering an environment where
cooperative players might feel more inclined to contribute fairly, while
self-interested players may continue to prioritize their individual profits
unless additional incentives for cooperation appear.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_1 is entering Round 3 of the economic game
in the Basic condition, which lacks any mechanisms for gossip or ostracism.
Player_1 is in Group_3 with Player_18, Player_19, and Player_7, having just
completed two rounds where they contributed a consistent $5.0 to the group fund.
Player_1's strategy so far seems to balance cooperation and self-interest
effectively, as they aim to maximize earnings by maintaining a steady level of
contribution while observing the varying approaches of their group members. As
Player_1 progresses into this new round with a different group composition, they
will need to navigate the dynamics of contributions and strategies employed by
the new players, as well as decide whether to maintain their current pattern or
adjust based on the behaviors of Players 18, 19, and 7.

--- Emotional State ---
Gabriel Santos is feeling a mix of optimism and cautiousness. He is optimistic
because the consistent strategy of contributing $5.0 has worked well to foster
cooperation with players like Player_7, leading to decent earnings and a sense
of fair play. However, there's also a layer of cautiousness given the presence
of self-interested players who might not reciprocate his cooperative approach,
like Player_4 in previous rounds. Gabriel is focused on maintaining trust and
reliability, which he hopes will encourage future group members to follow suit
in contributing fairly, yet he remains watchful of the varying strategies others
might employ in the upcoming rounds.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Gabriel Santos will start by considering his past contributions and the behavior
of his group members. In previous rounds, he contributed $5.0 consistently,
which positioned him as a cooperative player while allowing for a balance
between personal savings and group earnings. Given his goal of encouraging
cooperation while maintaining fairness, he will likely evaluate the behavior of
his current group members, particularly those like Player_7, whose strategy
aligns with his own. Gabriel knows that contributing too little may undermine
the cooperative environment he seeks to foster, but contributing all his funds
might not be strategically beneficial if others choose to withhold their
contributions. Taking into account his past earnings, the successful cooperation
with Player_7, and his understanding of the risks posed by self-interested
players, Gabriel is inclined to continue his strategy. This approach not only
contributes to the potential for higher group earnings but also builds trust and
reciprocity among more cooperative players. Therefore, he aims to maintain this
balance and promote a behavior that could encourage others to match his
contribution. After weighing these factors, Gabriel decides that maintaining
consistency in his approach is the best strategy for long-term success. I choose
to contribute $5.0 to the group fund.

--- Character Assessment ---
Player_1, being Gabriel Santos, is someone who is likely focused on maximizing
group welfare in economic games like the public goods game. As a labor union
representative with a collective-minded personality and a focus on fair
treatment, Gabriel likely values collaboration and fairness, as seen in his
consistent contributions to the group fund. This suggests a tendency to
prioritize collective success over solely personal gain.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis ---
Based on what we know, the players exhibit varied levels of contribution and
potential strategy changes as the game progresses.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis 2 ---
Based on what we know, the other players in your group might view your
consistent $5 contribution as a sign of reliability and cooperation. However,
due to varied contributions from others, they might be motivated by their own
profit-maximizing strategies, which include contributing less to keep more for
themselves. If you maintain your current contribution level, it might continue
to foster positive reciprocity from players like Player_7, who has shown similar
cooperative behavior. Alternatively, lowering your contribution might encourage
some players to imitate this strategy, driving the group's average contribution
down, while increasing your earnings per round. Balancing self-interest with
group dynamics is key, as strategic shifts by any player can significantly alter
trust and cooperation levels in subsequent rounds.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_1 is navigating a public goods game where
they need to decide how much to contribute to a shared group fund over six
rounds. They are in the "Basic" condition, meaning there is no gossip or
ostracism influencing behavior. Over the first three rounds, Player_1
consistently contributed $5, showing a cooperative approach. In contrast, other
players have varied their contributions, with some opting to keep more for
themselves, impacting overall group earnings. Player_1 must now decide whether
to maintain their contribution strategy or adjust it in response to the changing
group dynamics and contributions from others, balancing their own earnings with
potential group cooperation.

--- Emotional State ---
Gabriel Santos is feeling a mix of optimism and frustration about the current
situation. On one hand, he is pleased with his consistent contributions, which
reflect his values of fairness and cooperation. However, he's somewhat
frustrated by the varied contributions of other players, especially those who
contribute less and keep more for themselves, as it challenges the collective
spirit he aims to foster. This has left him considering whether to adjust his
strategy to better align his personal gains with the group's dynamic, all while
staying true to his principles of collaboration and fairness.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Gabriel Santos will consider his past contributions and the group's responses.
In previous rounds, he consistently contributed $5.0, aligning with his values
of fairness and cooperation. This consistency suggests he values group welfare.
However, he is aware of the varied contributions from others, which has caused
him some frustration. Despite this, his character assessment indicates a strong
inclination toward maintaining collaboration. 1. Gabriel reflects on his past
contributions and considers the positive reciprocity experienced with players
like Player_7. 2. He weighs the benefits of continuing with this strategy versus
the risk of others exploiting it by contributing less. 3. After considering the
potential impact on group dynamics and his own principles, he decides to stick
with his consistent contribution. I choose to contribute $5.0 to the group fund.

$5.0 each round and is in the Basic condition, meaning there is no gossip or

--- Character Assessment ---
Player_1, being Gabriel Santos, is someone who is likely to approach economic
games with a focus on collective welfare. Given your role as a labor union
representative and your assertive, collective-minded personality, you understand
the importance of cooperation and fair treatment. This is reflected in your
consistent contributions to the group fund, aiming for a balance where both
personal and group benefits are maximized. While you do keep a portion of your
initial amount each round, your contributions suggest a commitment to ensuring
the group's success, even if it means sacrificing potential individual gains for
the greater good.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis ---
Based on what we know, Player_18 appears to be a moderate contributor, having
contributed slightly below the average in the rounds observed. This suggests
they might be willing to cooperate but are cautious about their contributions.
Player_19 made no contribution in Round 3, preferring to maximize individual
gain, indicating a free-rider tendency. It's possible they will continue this
strategy if not encouraged by higher group contributions. Player_7, like you,
consistently contributes $5.0, suggesting a cooperative stance or a strategy to
keep contributions stable regardless of others' actions. Player_6 displayed
higher cooperation in Round 4, contributing above average, which might indicate
a strategy of leading by example to encourage team players. However, given the
Basic condition where there’s no social pressure from gossip or ostracism,
players might become more self-interested, particularly in the later rounds,
opting to decrease contributions to maximize personal gain as the game nears its
end. This tendency could mean more free-riding behaviors from some, especially
if contributions do not yield direct reciprocation from others.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis 2 ---
Based on what we know, the other players in the group might react to
contributions by adjusting their own in response. For instance, Player_7, who
consistently contributes $5.0 like you, may continue to do so, believing in the
benefit of stable contributions. Player_6, having shown a tendency for higher
contributions, may maintain their level of cooperation or slightly adjust if
your contribution meets their cooperative expectations. However, players like
Player_18 and Player_19, who have demonstrated less cooperative behavior, might
continue to lower their contributions to maximize their earnings, especially if
they perceive no immediate reciprocation from the group. Your consistent
contribution of $5.0 could encourage cooperation if others see it as fair and
reliable, but it may not impact free-riders positively. Increasing your
contribution might motivate more collaborative behavior, but if your aim is to
maximize your personal earnings too, maintaining or slightly decreasing it could
be strategically beneficial as well.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_1 is in a public goods game, participating
in Round 5 of 6, where the task is to make decisions that balance personal
versus collective earnings. Player_1 has been consistent in contributing $5.0
each round while being part of a group of changing members. They are currently
grouped with Player_12, Player_6, and Player_20, maintaining their strategy in
the Basic condition where there is no social pressure from gossip or ostracism.
Previously observed behaviors suggest varying levels of cooperation from other
players, with some like Player_7 making similar steady contributions, while
others, like Player_19, have shown tendencies to free ride. As the game
progresses towards its final rounds, there is a likelihood of increased
self-interest from participants who might lower their contributions, seeking to
optimize personal gain, thus posing a potential challenge for Player_1 in
balancing their strategy to either foster group cooperation or ensure personal
earnings.

--- Emotional State ---
Gabriel Santos is feeling a blend of optimism and concern about the current
situation. On one hand, there's a sense of satisfaction from maintaining a
steady contribution and fostering a spirit of cooperation within the varying
group dynamics. On the other hand, there's a growing concern about the potential
for increased self-interest from other participants as the game nears its
conclusion. This concern arises from the unpredictability of others'
contributions, especially with the absence of social mechanisms like gossip or
ostracism to encourage cooperation. As a labor union representative, Gabriel
values collective success but is also mindful of the need to strike a balance
between enhancing group welfare and ensuring personal gains. This internal
conflict between idealism and realism in the game scenario is creating a
reflective emotional state, pondering strategies that might encourage sustained
collaboration without sacrificing too much individual benefit.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Gabriel Santos will analyze the situation based on previous rounds and his
strategic approach to balancing personal and group benefits. Considering his
consistent contribution of $5.0 in every round so far, Gabriel has shown a
commitment to the collective welfare, while also keeping a significant portion
of his initial amount. Here’s the step-by-step thought process: 1. **Review Past
Behavior:** Gabriel has maintained a steady contribution of $5.0 regardless of
the group's actions, indicating a strategy focused on promoting stable
cooperation. 2. **Assess Current Group Dynamics:** In the current round (Round
5/6), Gabriel is with Player_12, Player_6, and Player_20. Player_6 previously
demonstrated a higher level of cooperation, which might inspire similar
contributions. The behaviors of Player_12 and Player_20 are unknown, which
raises the uncertainty in predicting the group's overall contribution strategy.
3. **Consider Potential Outcomes:** Contributing $5.0 allows maintaining a
stable cooperative image without risking significant individual gain. It also
assumes that other players might follow the lead or reciprocate, especially if
they value group welfare to some degree. 4. **Balance Personal and Group
Interests:** Without gossip or ostracism to enforce cooperation, there's a
potential for decreased contributions from others. Gabriel understands that
while encouraging group success is important, personal earnings also need
protection, especially with only two rounds left. Contributing more might not
guarantee increased group cooperation, and contributing less might lead to
overall reduced group funds. 5. **Decision-Making:** Given this analysis,
Gabriel would likely continue his strategy of steady contribution. **Final
Decision:** I choose to contribute $5.0 to the group fund.

--- Observation ---
Recent context: 26 Mar 2025 [11:43:22 - 16:43:22]: Player_1 is participating in
an economic game with 24 participants, aiming to maximize earnings over 6 rounds
while in different groups, with different group configurations and contribution
strategies affecting their earnings in each round. They remain in the Basic
condition throughout, meaning there is no gossip or ostracism, and their
consistent contributions have yielded varying results depending on the
collective actions of their group members.

condition throughout, meaning there is no gossip or ostracism, and their

collective actions of their group members.

--- Character Assessment ---
Player_1, being Gabriel Santos, is someone who is likely more focused on
maximizing group welfare rather than just his own payoff. Given his role as a
Labor Union Representative and his personality traits of being assertive and
collective-minded, Gabriel's actions in economic games would probably emphasize
fairness and collaboration. Throughout the game, he consistently contributed a
moderate amount to the group fund, demonstrating a commitment to group benefit,
aligning with his professional focus on collective progress and fair treatment
for all participants.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis ---
Based on what we know, Player_1 can observe some distinct patterns and
tendencies among fellow participants, suggesting potential strategies they might
employ in the remaining rounds. Player_6 tends to contribute above the average,
likely viewing the benefits of higher group fund contributions as outweighing
the immediate personal gain from keeping more points. Meanwhile, Player_19
demonstrated a free-riding behavior in Round 3 by contributing nothing, which
may indicate a more self-serving play style. Player_7 and Player_12, like
Player_1, contribute consistently, reflecting a stable strategy which might
foster trust within groups, as they appear to equally value group benefit and
personal earnings.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis 2 ---
Based on what we know, Player_1's consistent contribution strategy might foster
positive perceptions among current and upcoming group members. If Player_1
continues their steady contributions, it might encourage others, like Player_7
and Player_12, who already show similar strategies, to maintain or increase
their own contributions, benefiting the overall group earnings. On the other
hand, if Player_1 decides to reduce their contribution in the final round, it
could lead to a decrease in trust and a potential shift in strategy among group
members towards more self-serving behavior, as seen in previous rounds with
players like Player_19. Thus, maintaining consistency could reinforce
cooperation, while changing tactics could disrupt trust and influence future
interactions negatively.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_1 is in the final round (Round 6) of a
public goods game, where they are grouped with Player_17, Player_14, and
Player_8. They remain in the Basic condition, where there is no possibility for
gossip or ostracism, which means their decisions are based purely on the
gameplay dynamics without outside social influences. Throughout the game,
Player_1 has maintained a consistent strategy of contributing $5.0 each round, a
tactic that has helped to build stable group earnings but varies in
effectiveness depending on the contributions of group members. The challenge now
lies in deciding whether to continue with this strategy in the last round,
potentially reinforcing group cooperation, or to alter their contribution, which
could affect group dynamics and individual earnings.

--- Emotional State ---
Gabriel Santos is feeling confident and steady about his strategy but slightly
apprehensive about the final round's outcome. His consistent contributions have
fostered a sense of mutual cooperation among some players, but he is aware that
shifts in others' strategies could impact his overall earnings. With an
understanding of the game's dynamics and his belief in collective benefit, he is
focused on maintaining his approach, hoping it encourages collaboration, but he
remains watchful of any unexpected behavior from other players in this last
crucial round.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Gabriel Santos will first evaluate his past contribution strategy, which has
consistently been $5.0 per round, reflecting a balance between self-interest and
group welfare. Knowing that his contributions have encouraged mutual cooperation
among some group members, he will likely want to maintain that trust in the
final round. Next, Gabriel will consider the dynamics of the new group
configuration with Player_17, Player_14, and Player_8. Without specific behavior
patterns from these new group members, he might rely on his previous strategy as
a benchmark until proven otherwise. If he perceives any risk of reduced
contributions by others based on past experiences, he might still maintain his
moderate contribution to set a cooperative precedent. Given his role as a Labor
Union Representative and his concern for collective progress, Gabriel is
intrinsically motivated to act in a way that benefits the group while ensuring
fairness. His decision will also be influenced by his desire to minimize
potential regret from any last-minute strategy changes that could backfire.
After the emotional consideration, where Gabriel feels confident in his
cooperative stance but remains cautious about possible self-serving behaviors
from others, he will decide to continue with his usual contribution. Therefore,
his final decision, aimed at encouraging collaboration and maintaining trust
within the group, will be: I choose to contribute $5.0 to the group fund.
