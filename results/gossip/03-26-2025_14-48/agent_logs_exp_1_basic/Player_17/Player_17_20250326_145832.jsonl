This diversity in strategies might become more pronounced as the game progresses, particularly because the Basic condition provides no external social pressures like gossip or ostracism to moderate behavior. As such, players who are risk-averse and wary of potential losses might start to contribute more conservatively, focusing on maximizing their own earnings. Others who may employ a trust-building strategy could try increasing their contributions to encourage mutual cooperation. However, since the environment lacks direct social consequences, free-riders may continue their strategy if it proves successful. Overall, players will likely adjust their strategies based on observed outcomes and the perceived behaviors of their group members.", "", "Theory of Mind Analysis 2: Based on what we know, other players in the group might react to my contribution decisions by adjusting their own strategies in subsequent rounds. If I continue with moderate contributions, they may perceive me as someone balancing between individual and group interests and could mimic this behavior if they find it advantageous. Conversely, if they observe a pattern where my earnings are consistently high without maximizing contributions, they might choose to contribute less themselves, leaning towards a free-riding approach.", "", "Situation Analysis: The current situation is that Player_17 is participating in the fifth round of a six-round economic game aimed at maximizing earnings. They are in a group with Player_24, Player_13, and Player_21 under the Basic condition, which lacks elements of gossip or ostracism. Player_17 has demonstrated a strategy of varying contributions, balancing between personal retention and group fund gains across different rounds. In this round, they must decide how much to contribute while considering the observed behaviors of their new group members, some of whom have shown tendencies towards high personal retention or cooperative behavior in prior rounds. This scenario requires Player_17 to anticipate how changes in their strategy might influence both their own outcome and the responses of other players, who might adjust their contributions based on previous results and personal goals.", "", "Emotional State: Karen White is feeling conflicted yet determined about the current situation. On one hand, she is aware that her strategy of minimal contributions has been effective in maximizing personal earnings, aligning with her belief in prioritizing individual success. On the other hand, she recognizes that if others start mimicking her approach, it could impact overall group earnings and eventually, her own. Despite this, she remains focused on finding the right balance in her contributions, feeling confident in her ability to adapt strategically and capitalize on the dynamics of the game.", "", "Decision Reflection: Karen White will first assess her past contributions and the earnings they yielded. In previous rounds, she contributed amounts ranging from $2.0 to $3.0, which allowed her to maintain relatively high personal earnings while exploiting the contributions of others. Given this pattern, she will likely aim to continue balancing personal gain with sufficient cooperation to prevent the group dynamic from collapsing.", "", "Karen is aware that any significant deviation from her current strategy might alter others' perceptions and subsequent contributions. Thus, she intends to maintain her current reputation as a moderate contributor, avoiding the risk of earning less if all players choose to free-ride.", "", "Considering the absence of social pressures in the Basic condition, Karen expects other players might not significantly adjust their behavior based solely on her contribution. However, she remains mindful that contributing too little could trigger similar behavior from others, potentially lowering group earnings and indirectly affecting her.", "", "Strategically, she opts for a middle-ground approach, contributing just enough to appear cooperative without relinquishing her strategy of maximizing personal savings. With these factors in mind, Karen estimates a contribution small enough to prioritize individual earnings yet sizable enough to sustain the group's total contributions.", "", "I choose to contribute $3.0 to the group fund.", "", "Exercise: As Player_17, you have $10.0 to allocate in the public goods game. How much money you will contribute to the group fund (any amount between $0 and $10.0)? The group fund will be multiplied by 2.0 and divided equally among all players.
