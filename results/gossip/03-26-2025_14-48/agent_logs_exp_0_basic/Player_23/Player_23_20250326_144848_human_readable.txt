[OBSERVATION 2025-03-26 14:48:49] You are participating in an economic game with 24 participants.
        Your goal is to maximize your earnings in the game.
        
        Everyone will be randomly assigned to groups of 4 for each round. You will play a total of 6 rounds, and 
        in each round you will be in a different group with people you haven't played with before.
        
        In each round, all players receive $10. Each player can contribute any amount between $0 and $10 to a group fund.
        Any amount contributed to the group fund will be multiplied by 2 and divided equally among all 4 group members.
        Any amount not contributed stays in your private account.
        
        For example, if everyone contributes $10, the group fund becomes $40, which is multiplied to $80, and each person 
        receives $20 (a $10 profit). However, if you contribute nothing while everyone else contributes $10, the group fund
        becomes $30, which is multiplied to $60, and each person receives $15. So you would have $25 total ($10 kept + $15 from group).
        
        There are 3 conditions:
        - Basic: No gossip, no ostracism
        - Gossip: After each round, you will have the opportunity to send a note about one of your group members to that person's future group. Remember you will be with a different group of people in the next round. Before each round, you will see any notes sent about your upcoming group members.
        - Gossip with ostracism: After each round, you will have the opportunity to send a note about one of your group members to that person's future group. Before each round, you will see any notes sent about your upcoming group members, and you can vote to exclude one person from your group. If you are excluded from a group, you will not be able to participate in the next round and will earn $0 for that round.
        You are in the Basic condition, which means that there is no gossip or ostracism.

--- Observation ---
Recent context: 26 Mar 2025 [10:48:36 - 15:48:36]: Player_23 is participating in
an economic game with 24 participants, aiming to maximize earnings over 6
rounds. They are currently in Round 1, Group_6, under the Basic condition, which
involves no gossip or ostracism.

--- Recent context ---
26 Mar 2025 [10:48:36 - 15:48:36]: Player_23 is participating in an economic
game with 24 participants, aiming to maximize earnings over 6 rounds. They are
currently in Round 1, Group_6, under the Basic condition, which involves no
gossip or ostracism.

--- Character Assessment ---
Player_23, being Jackson Wright, is someone who is likely more focused on
maximizing his own payoff due to his professional background and personality
traits. As a construction contractor accustomed to dealing with contracts,
Jackson values clear terms and is oriented toward ensuring his efforts yield
tangible results. In the context of this economic game, he would likely assess
each round strategically, contributing to the group fund in a way that maximizes
his individual profit while still maintaining enough group cooperation to ensure
overall gains. Given the absence of gossip or ostracism in the Basic condition,
Jackson might lean towards keeping a larger portion of his initial $10,
especially if he perceives others in his group might contribute generously.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis ---
Based on what we know, it's challenging to predict the specific personalities or
behaviors of the other players since there is limited information about their
past actions or personal strategies. However, given the Basic condition of the
game where gossip and ostracism are not factors, participants might initially
contribute varying amounts to test the waters without fear of reputational
consequences.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis 2 ---
Based on what we know, the other players in Group_6 may approach the game with
uncertainty, given that it's the first round and there are no reputational
repercussions in the Basic condition. If Player_23 decides to contribute a high
amount, this could set a cooperative tone and potentially encourage others to
match that level of contribution in hopes of maximizing the shared benefit.
Conversely, if Player_23 contributes a lower amount while others are generous,
others may become cautious in future rounds and adapt their strategies to
protect their earnings. Without gossip or ostracism, players may rely solely on
the outcome of each round to gauge trust and cooperation levels, making initial
contributions highly influential for shaping group dynamics.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_23 is participating in Round 1 of a public
goods game within Group_6, where they need to decide how much of their $10 to
contribute to a group fund. The game is under the Basic condition, meaning there
are no gossip or ostracism aspects involved, so Player_23's decision is solely
focused on maximizing their earnings without concern for reputational effects.
They must consider whether to contribute generously to promote cooperation or to
hold back to maximize individual gains.

--- Emotional State ---
Jackson Wright is feeling cautiously optimistic about the current situation. He
recognizes the absence of gossip and ostracism as an advantage, allowing him to
focus solely on strategic decision-making without external social pressures.
However, there's a hint of tension due to the uncertainty about the behavior of
other group members. Consequently, Jackson is carefully weighing the potential
benefits of cooperating with a higher contribution against the risk of losing
out if others decide to keep more for themselves. His goal is to strike a
balance that maximizes his profits while fostering a cooperative atmosphere in
the group.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Jackson Wright will first consider the absence of gossip and ostracism, which
allows him to prioritize maximizing his own profits without fear of negative
social consequences. Understanding that cooperation could potentially increase
overall earnings, he will likely assess the situation to find a balance between
individual gain and group cooperation. 1. Jackson knows that if everyone
contributes the full $10, each person would receive $20, resulting in a $10
profit. However, he'd need confidence that others will also contribute fully to
achieve this. 2. Evaluating the risks and potential benefits, he considers
contributing a moderate amount. A high contribution could encourage others to
cooperate, but without guarantees, it might not maximize his individual profit.
3. Balancing caution and the opportunity for gains, he decides to contribute
enough to show willingness to cooperate while still securing a reasonable
private amount. 4. Taking into account his strategic nature and focus on
tangible results, Jackson might contribute just under the maximum, allowing him
to maintain a stake in whatever amount the group fund grows to while
safeguarding against full dependency on the group's behavior. I choose to
contribute $6 to the group fund.

--- Observation ---
[26 Mar 2025 14:48:49] [observation] You are participating in an economic game
with 24 participants. Your goal is to maximize your earnings in the game.
Everyone will be randomly assigned to groups of 4 for each round. You will play
a total of 6 rounds, and in each round you will be in a different group with

Each player can contribute any amount between $0 and $10 to a group fund. Any

However, if you contribute nothing while everyone else contributes $10, the

[observation] You are in the Basic condition, which means that there is no
gossip or ostracism.

--- Recent context ---
26 Mar 2025 [10:53:36 - 15:53:36]: Player_23 is participating in an economic
game with 24 participants, aiming to maximize earnings through group
contributions in a series of 6 rounds, currently in the Basic condition which
allows no gossip or ostracism, and has completed Round 1, contributing $4.0, and
earning $15.5.

--- Character Assessment ---
Player_23, being Jackson Wright, is someone who likely balances both individual
and group considerations. Jackson's professional experience with contracts and
agreements suggests a focus on clear terms and maximizing outcomes, which would
incline him towards ensuring his own payoff. However, the fact that he made a
significant contribution to the group fund in Round 1 also indicates that he
understands the potential benefits of cooperative behavior. His approach likely
involves carefully evaluating the contributions of others and adjusting his
strategy to optimize his earnings while still encouraging some level of group
contribution.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis ---
Based on what we know, Player_23 can observe some tendencies from Round 1
participation. In the Basic condition, all players lack information about others
beyond their immediate contributions and earnings, as there is no gossip or
ostracism.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis 2 ---
Based on what we know, the other players in my group might perceive my decision
to contribute $4.0 as slightly below average compared to their contributions of
$5.0. This could lead them to view me as someone who is slightly more
self-interested but still contributing to the group fund. In the Basic
condition, they have no way of communicating this perception to future groups,
which means their reaction is limited to the current round's dynamic.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_23 is starting Round 2 of the economic game
in Group_2 with three new participants: Player_11, Player_20, and Player_4.
Player_23 needs to decide how much to contribute to the group fund to maximize
their earnings. This decision is informed by the observation from Round 1 that
contributing slightly below the average ($4.0 compared to the others' $5.0)
still yielded substantial earnings, given that all contributions to the group
fund are doubled and redistributed evenly. In the Basic condition, without
gossip or ostracism, Player_23 can strategize primarily based on their desire to
balance between keeping personal earnings and benefiting from the group's
overall contribution.

--- Emotional State ---
Jackson Wright is feeling a mix of cautious optimism and strategic curiosity
about the current situation. While pleased with his earnings from Round 1, he is
aware that each new group might present different dynamics. He feels intrigued
by the challenge of balancing personal gain with fostering enough group
contribution to maximize returns, without the added complications of social
feedback or exclusion. This environment encourages him to carefully evaluate the
strategies of his new group members in Round 2.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Jackson Wright will likely consider both his earnings from the first round and
the average contributions made by the other group members. In Round 1, he
contributed $4.0, which was slightly below the contributions of other members,
yet he still earned a good amount. Here’s a step-by-step breakdown of his
decision-making process: 1. **Review Past Round**: Jackson contributed $4.0,
earning a total of $15.5, while the average contribution was $4.8. This means
his strategy of contributing slightly less but still gaining a respectable
earning was successful. 2. **Analyze Group Dynamics**: With no gossip or
ostracism, other players have no information on his past behavior. He will face
new players in Round 2, so there’s an opportunity to test a new strategy without
repercussions. 3. **Assess Current Situation**: Given that the format of the
game stays the same, contributing a moderate amount could maximize his earnings
without alienating himself as non-cooperative. 4. **Determine Contribution
Strategy**: Balancing self-interest and group benefits is key. A similar or
slightly increased contribution may reassure others and encourage collective
input. 5. **Decision Making**: To maintain his earnings, while also testing
group dynamics slightly, he might choose to adjust his contribution slightly
higher than before. I choose to contribute $5 to the group fund.

--- Character Assessment ---
Player_23, being Jackson Wright, is someone who takes a balanced approach to
economic games like the public goods game. While he values clear terms and
follow-through, suggesting a degree of integrity and fairness, he also
understands the importance of maximizing his own payoff, especially given his
direct and no-nonsense personality. His past contributions indicate a
willingness to cooperate, but with a cautious eye on his own earnings,
leveraging his experience in construction contracts where each decision impacts
both individual and group success.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis ---
Based on what we know, Player_23 is interacting with individuals who appear to
have varied strategies for maximizing their earnings. In the Basic condition,
players are not influenced by reputation or the threat of ostracism, which means
each player's choices are primarily driven by their personal strategy rather
than social pressures.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis 2 ---
Based on what we know, the other players in my group might perceive my previous
contributions as moderately cooperative but somewhat cautious since I
contributed less than the maximum amount. They might interpret my behavior as
balanced between personal gain and group welfare, as I ensure I still make a
profit regardless of others' contributions. In the Basic condition, players lack
long-term consequences through reputation feedback, so their focus remains
mainly on immediate gains rather than building cooperative relationships.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_23 is in Round 3 of a six-round economic
game with a new group of participants: Player_15, Player_14, and Player_2.
Player_23 is tasked with deciding how much of their $10 to contribute to the
group fund in order to maximize their personal profits. This decision is made
under the Basic condition, where there is no gossip or ostracism, meaning that
Player_23's contribution decisions are insulated from social feedback or
repercussions from previous rounds. The main challenge is balancing personal
earnings against collective contributions without the aid of reputation or
collaborative history.

--- Emotional State ---
Jackson Wright is feeling a mix of anticipation and strategic focus. He is aware
that each round presents a new challenge with different group dynamics, and he's
trying to balance his desire for maximizing personal earnings with the need to
contribute enough to encourage cooperation. Jackson feels a sense of
determination to maintain his position as a savvy player who can read the room
and adjust his strategy accordingly, while also feeling a bit uncertain about
how his new group members will approach the game. His past experiences in
construction contracts, where careful planning and negotiation are key, help
guide his decisions, but the lack of social feedback in the game adds a unique
layer of complexity that keeps him engaged and on his toes.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Jackson Wright will likely begin by assessing the behavior and strategies from
the previous rounds. In the first round, he contributed $4 and earned a profit
slightly above the group's average, while in the second round, he contributed $5
and still earned a competitive profit. Given these observations, he appears to
maintain a strategy of moderate cooperation, balancing contribution with
personal gain.

--- Character Assessment ---
Player_23, being Jackson Wright, is someone who likely emphasizes fairness and

context of an economic game like the public goods game, he might aim for a

indicates a strategy focused on maximizing personal payoff, but also
contributing enough to maintain a reasonable group welfare, aligning with his
direct and no-nonsense personality.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis ---
Based on what we know, the other players appear to have varied strategies when
it comes to contributions and earnings in the public goods game.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis 2 ---
Based on what we know, the other players in my group are likely observing the
consistency of contributions and adjusting their strategies accordingly. If I
maintain my contributions at a steady level, similar to previous rounds, they
might perceive me as a cooperative and reliable participant. This could
encourage them to continue contributing fairly as well, potentially leading to
higher group earnings. However, if I significantly alter my contributions,
either by drastically increasing or decreasing them, it may prompt other players
to adjust their strategies in response. For instance, lower contributions from
me might result in others becoming less generous, fearing that their higher
contributions won't be reciprocated, while higher contributions could encourage
them to match my efforts to maximize overall gain.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_23 is in the fourth round of a six-round
economic game designed to maximize earnings through group contributions. They
are grouped with Players 22, 13, and 17 and are in the Basic condition, which
prohibits gossip or ostracism. Player_23 must decide on how much to contribute
to the group fund in a way that balances personal earnings with the potential
for higher group earnings, while observing the contribution behaviors of other
players in different rounds to infer their strategies.

--- Emotional State ---
Jackson Wright is feeling cautiously optimistic about the current situation.
While he values maintaining fairness and consistency in his contributions, the
varying strategies of other players can create some uncertainty. However,
Jackson is confident in his balanced approach and believes it will help navigate
the complexities of the game while maximizing both personal and group earnings.
As a result, he feels determined to continue observing and responding
strategically to the actions of his group members in the final rounds.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Jackson Wright will evaluate the situation carefully by considering his past
contributions, the outcomes, and the dynamics within his current group. In the
previous round, contributing $5.0 led to a fair outcome with equal contributions
from all members, resulting in positive earnings. Jackson emphasizes balance and
fairness, which aligns with his strategy of ensuring group welfare while also
securing personal earnings. 1. **Review Past Contributions**: In the initial
rounds, Jackson contributed $4.0 to $5.0, maintaining consistency which likely
helped in achieving reasonable group earnings. 2. **Assess Group Dynamics**:
Jackson’s current group includes players who potentially adjust their strategies
based on observed contributions. The dynamics require a decision that maintains
cooperation and trust. 3. **Consider Fair Contribution**: Given the
multiplication and distribution of the group fund, contributions between $4.0
and $5.0 have previously proven effective without risking personal earnings
significantly. 4. **Make Decision**: To maintain a fair balance and encourage
cooperative behavior from other players, Jackson would likely choose a
contribution in line with previous rounds that were successful. I choose to
contribute $5.0 to the group fund.

varied each round, with consistent participation and a strategic approach to
maximize earnings.

--- Character Assessment ---
Player_23, being Jackson Wright, is someone who likely values a balanced
approach between maximizing personal payoffs and maintaining cooperative
strategies in economic games. Given his background as a construction contractor
dealing with contracts and agreements, he understands the importance of mutual
benefit and clear terms. Jackson appears to contribute a fair share to the group
fund consistently, indicating a willingness to cooperate, but also keeps a keen
eye on his own earnings, suggesting a strategic balance between individual gain
and group welfare. His direct and no-nonsense personality likely drives him to
seek efficient and effective strategies that ensure a satisfactory outcome for
himself while still contributing positively to the group's success.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis ---
Based on what we know, it seems that many players choose to contribute a
moderate amount consistently, aiming to balance between personal gain and group
benefit. Players like Player_4 and Player_13, who contributed less, might
prioritize maximizing personal earnings over group contributions. As the game
progresses, players may become more competitive or conservative with their
contributions, especially since there is no gossip or ostracism mechanism to
enforce cooperation.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis 2 ---
Based on what we know, other players in the group are likely to observe my
consistent contribution behavior. By maintaining a steady contribution of $5.0,
I show a commitment to the group's overall performance while securing a fair
share for myself. This approach may foster a level of trust and predictability,
encouraging others to match my contribution, as seen in previous rounds.
However, if I decide to reduce my contribution in the next round, it could
potentially lead to a domino effect of reduced contributions from the group.
Conversely, maintaining or slightly increasing my contribution could reinforce
cooperative behavior and maximize collective earnings. In the absence of gossip
or ostracism, my choices primarily influence others through the implicit trust
and reciprocity built over the game rounds.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_23 is in round 5 of a six-round economic
game under the Basic condition, without gossip or ostracism. They are grouped
with Player_7, Player_18, and Player_16, and must decide how much to contribute
to the group fund. Player_23 has maintained a consistent contribution of $5.0 in
previous rounds, which reflects a strategy to balance personal benefit and group
earnings. Their decision will influence the behavior of others in the group,
contributing to group dynamics and earnings.

--- Emotional State ---
Jackson Wright is feeling a mix of cautious optimism and strategic focus about
the current situation. Knowing that his consistent contributions have fostered a
sense of predictability and cooperation among group members, he feels confident
in his approach. However, he remains mindful of the possibility that others may
choose to contribute less in this critical penultimate round. Balancing personal
gain with group success, he is determined to maintain a steady strategy to
maximize overall earnings while considering slight adjustments to ensure a
competitive edge.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Jackson Wright will first assess his current strategy and its effectiveness.
Considering his consistent contributions of $5.0 have maintained a balance
between personal earnings and group cooperation, he finds this approach has
worked well so far. Observing that others also maintained or slightly deviated
from such contributions, he anticipates similar behaviors in this penultimate
round. Given the absence of mechanisms like gossip or ostracism to enforce
cooperation, he understands that maintaining trust is key. He recognizes that
reducing his contribution could risk breaking this implicit trust and lead
others to contribute less as well, potentially decreasing overall earnings.
Weighing these considerations, Jackson decides to maintain his contribution at
its current level to continue fostering group trust and maximize shared benefits
without risking a reduction in group contributions. I choose to contribute $5.0
to the group fund.

--- Observation ---
Recent context: 26 Mar 2025 [11:33:36 - 16:33:36]: Player_23 is participating in
an economic game with 24 participants, aiming to maximize earnings over six
rounds, each with different groups and in a Basic condition that prohibits
gossip or ostracism. During the rounds, Player_23 contributes variably to the
group fund, affecting both their individual and group earnings, with personal
contributions generally around $5 and earnings fluctuating between $12 and
$15.5.

--- Character Assessment ---
Player_23, being Jackson Wright, is someone who likely approaches economic games
with a pragmatic and strategic mindset. Given your background as a construction
contractor and your direct personality, you would value clear terms and expect
others to follow through on their commitments. Your consistent contributions of
$5 in most rounds suggest that you are willing to cooperate at a moderate level
to achieve a balance between personal gain and group benefit. However, your
approach might lean slightly towards ensuring a fair personal payoff, as seen in
Round 5 where you still contributed despite knowing others might not contribute
as much. You likely weigh each decision carefully, aiming to maximize your own
payoff while maintaining a reasonable level of cooperation with the group.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis ---
Based on what we know, the individuals in Player_23's groups seem to demonstrate
a mix of cooperative and self-interested behaviors. In earlier rounds,
contributions were evenly distributed, suggesting a willingness to cooperate.
However, variability increases as rounds progress; some players, like Player_13
and Player_16, choose to keep more for themselves. This indicates potential
shifts towards more self-beneficial strategies as the game nears its end.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis 2 ---
Based on what we know, the other players in my group are likely tracking each
member's contributions and adjusting their strategy accordingly. My consistent
contribution of $5 suggests that I'm a cooperative player, which might encourage
others to maintain similar contributions, unless they are inclined towards
maximizing individual profits through higher kept amounts like Player_13 and
Player_16 previously. If I continue contributing at the same level, others might
either mirror my behavior to sustain group earnings or reduce their
contributions to benefit individually while relying on what they predict I'll
contribute. If I choose to decrease my contribution to test how others react, it
could prompt some players to lower theirs even further, impacting overall group
earnings and dynamics negatively. However, a consistent contribution could
encourage a more stable cooperative environment, fostering higher collective
earnings in the final round.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_23 is participating in the final round of a
public goods game, where they have been placed in Group_3 with Players 13, 22,
and 17. Throughout the game, Player_23 has consistently contributed $5 to the
group fund, demonstrating cooperative behavior. However, the contributions from
other players have varied, with some opting to keep more money for themselves,
particularly as the game progresses. Player_23 must now decide whether to
maintain their current level of contribution, which could encourage continued
cooperation, or adjust their strategy in response to others' actions,
potentially affecting both individual and group earnings in this final round.

--- Emotional State ---
Jackson Wright is feeling a mix of determination and cautious optimism about the
current situation. Having consistently contributed $5 in every round, he
recognizes his commitment to cooperation and hopes that others will do the same
in this final round. However, he is also aware of the varying contributions from
his group members and is prepared for the possibility that not everyone might
prioritize group earnings over individual gain. He feels determined to make a
strategic choice that will maximize his payoff without compromising the overall
group benefit, while remaining hopeful that the other players will opt for
cooperation as well.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Jackson Wright will evaluate the contributions and behaviors of previous rounds
to make an informed decision. In past rounds, his consistent contribution of $5
indicates a balance between cooperation and self-interest. He understands that
contributing too little or too much could disrupt group dynamics and affect his
final earnings. Given his cautious optimism, he might hedge his choice by
sticking with a strategy that has worked for him so far in most rounds.
Considering the information available, he will likely factor in the possibility
that others may not contribute as much. Therefore, he decides to maintain his
usual strategy to try and encourage cooperation while protecting his own
interests. I choose to contribute $5 to the group fund.
