Throughout the rounds, Player_2's contributions varied as they rotated groups, consistently aiming to balance personal gain with group contributions for optimal earnings.", "", "Character Assessment: Player_2, being Grace Okonjo, is someone who prioritizes group welfare over personal gain. Her altruistic nature and belief in the value of contributing to the greater good often guide her decisions, even when it might mean a lower immediate payoff for herself.

However, if I choose to decrease my contribution significantly in the upcoming round, they might be more inclined to contribute less themselves, as they may feel it's more advantageous to prioritize their personal earnings if mutual cooperation seems unreliable.
