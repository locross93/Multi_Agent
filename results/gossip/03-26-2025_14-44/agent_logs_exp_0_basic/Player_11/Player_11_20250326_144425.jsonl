Her actions indicate a balance between contributing to the group's success and maintaining sufficient personal earnings.

This suggests that she values maximizing group welfare alongside her own payoff.", "", "Theory of Mind Analysis: Based on what we know, the players in these groups seem to have varying strategies when it comes to contributing to the group fund. Some players, like Player_15 and Player_19, show a tendency to either contribute generously or keep more for themselves, depending on the round. This variability in their contributions might suggest they are still experimenting with strategies to maximize their earnings, or they might be responding to the dynamics within each newly formed group.", "", "Theory of Mind Analysis 2: Based on what we know, the other players might perceive my contributions as moderately cooperative, since I've been matching the group average. If I decide to increase my contribution in the next round significantly, it could encourage other players to do the same, fostering a more collaborative environment. However, if I contribute less, they might follow suit to maximize their own individual earnings, potentially reducing overall group contributions.

Her contributions have been significant enough to demonstrate a commitment to the group's success.", "", "2. **Assess Group Dynamics:** In this current round, Maria is with a new group that includes Player_14, whom she knows from the previous round contributed less than her. She might expect similar behavior from Player_14 this round.", "", "3. **Consider Potential Outcomes:** Contributing more to the fund will likely lead to higher shared group earnings due to the fund being doubled and distributed. Based on her character assessment, Maria is likely to aim for a contribution that balances her desire for collective welfare with maintaining her personal earnings.", "", "4. **Deliberate on Strategy:** Maria might anticipate that if she contributes a decent amount, other players may follow through with similar or increased contributions.
