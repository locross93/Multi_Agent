Players like Player_8 and Player_24\u2019s strategies are unknown, raising uncertainty in expectations. Given the lack of gossip or ostracism and the absence of a pattern from Player_8 and Player_24, Boris will likely maintain his moderate strategy with a minor increase, considering the increased risk in the final round.
