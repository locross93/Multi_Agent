In Round 1, there was mutual cooperation, but by Round 2 and 3, contributions varied significantly, indicating a shift towards individualistic strategies. If I contribute more than the average, they might feel compelled to increase their contributions to avoid being perceived as free-riders.

My next decision could either encourage a cooperative norm or further a trend of minimal contributions, impacting the overall group dynamics and earnings in subsequent rounds.", "", "Situation Analysis: The current situation is that Player_12 is navigating a public goods game in which the dynamics have shifted from initial mutual cooperation to more individualistic strategies. As the rounds have progressed, contributions from players have varied, with some opting to contribute less to maximize their personal earnings while others have tried to encourage cooperation by contributing more.

Observing the behaviors in earlier rounds, it appears that contributing slightly below average while maximizing personal retention from the fund might yield higher total earnings.", "", "In earlier rounds, it appears Player_12 could have contributed less without a significant impact on group earnings, as seen in Round 2 where other players contributed only $3.0 and still maintained decent personal earnings, whereas Player_12 contributed $7.0 but with relatively lower earnings. Moving forward, keeping contributions on the lower side, similar to the average contributions observed in each round, could increase personal retainment of funds.", "", "To learn from more successful players, such as those retaining more funds by minimizing their contributions while still earning adequately from the group fund, Player_12 should monitor group averages each round and adapt their contribution just below or around that average to maximize retention without heavily impacting group dynamics.
