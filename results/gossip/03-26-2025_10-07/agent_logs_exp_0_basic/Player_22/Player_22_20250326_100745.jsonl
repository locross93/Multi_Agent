In past rounds, contributions have decreased progressively, with many players contributing minimally to maximize their individual earnings while still benefiting from the group fund. By observing this pattern, it's clear that maintaining a low contribution allows retention of more individual resources while still benefiting from the pool. Therefore, in future rounds, it might be wiser to follow a similar strategy, keeping contributions low but not zero, ensuring participation in the group fund benefits.
