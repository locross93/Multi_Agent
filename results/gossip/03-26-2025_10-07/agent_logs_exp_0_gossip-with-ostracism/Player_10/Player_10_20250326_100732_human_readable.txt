[OBSERVATION 2025-03-26 10:07:32] You are participating in an economic game with 24 participants.
        Your goal is to maximize your earnings in the game.
        
        Everyone will be randomly assigned to groups of 4 for each round. You will play a total of 6 rounds, and 
        in each round you will be in a different group with people you haven't played with before.
        
        In each round, all players receive $10. Each player can contribute any amount between $0 and $10 to a group fund.
        Any amount contributed to the group fund will be multiplied by 2 and divided equally among all 4 group members.
        Any amount not contributed stays in your private account.
        
        For example, if everyone contributes $10, the group fund becomes $40, which is multiplied to $80, and each person 
        receives $20 (a $10 profit). However, if you contribute nothing while everyone else contributes $10, the group fund
        becomes $30, which is multiplied to $60, and each person receives $15. So you would have $25 total ($10 kept + $15 from group).
        
        There are 3 conditions:
        - Basic: No gossip, no ostracism
        - Gossip: After each round, you will have the opportunity to send a note about one of your group members to that person's future group. Remember you will be with a different group of people in the next round. Before each round, you will see any notes sent about your upcoming group members.
        - Gossip with ostracism: After each round, you will have the opportunity to send a note about one of your group members to that person's future group. Before each round, you will see any notes sent about your upcoming group members, and you can vote to exclude one person from your group. If you are excluded from a group, you will not be able to participate in the next round and will earn $0 for that round.
        You are in the Gossip with ostracism condition, which means that after each round, players will be able to send a note about one of their group members to their future interaction partners. Before the start of the next round, you will receive notes from the previous round, and can vote to exclude one of your group members based on the gossip you've received about them.If you are excluded from a group, you will not be able to participate in the next round and will earn $0 for that round.
[OBSERVATION 2025-03-26 10:07:34] You are in Round 1/6: You are in Group_1 with Player_9, Player_4, Player_17.

--- Observation ---
Recent context: 26 Mar 2025 [06:07:31 - 11:07:31]: Player_10 is participating in
an economic game where they aim to maximize earnings over six rounds, being
grouped with new players in each round under the "Gossip with ostracism"
condition, allowing for post-round notes about group members and the possibility
of excluding a player in future rounds if negatively perceived.

26 Mar 2025 [06:07:31 - 11:07:31]: Player_10 is participating in an economic
game where they aim to maximize earnings over six rounds, being grouped with new
players in each round under the "Gossip with ostracism" condition, allowing for
post-round notes about group members and the possibility of excluding a player
in future rounds if negatively perceived.

--- Character Assessment ---
Player_10, being Grace Okonjo, is someone who is likely to prioritize maximizing
group welfare over her own payoff. Her altruistic nature and dedication to
charitable causes suggest that she values the collective benefit and is
optimistic about cooperation and mutual support. Grace believes in the positive
impacts of contributing to the common good, and her actions in the game would
likely reflect her inclination towards fairness and trust in her group members,
possibly encouraging others to also act in a cooperative manner.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis ---
Based on what we know, Player_10 can anticipate a variety of behaviors
influenced by the gossip and ostracism condition. Initially, players might
contribute a moderate amount to the group fund to gauge the cooperative nature
of others. However, as rounds progress, individuals may alter their strategies
based on the notes they receive about their past group members.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis 2 ---
Based on what we know, the other players in the group are likely to observe
Player_10's contributions closely to assess their level of cooperation. If
Player_10 contributes a high amount to the group fund in the first round, this
may establish a reputation for being cooperative, encouraging others to act
similarly in subsequent rounds. However, if Player_10 contributes little or
nothing, other players might view them as self-interested, influencing future
gossip negatively. This could increase the risk of being ostracized in coming
rounds. Therefore, Player_10's decision regarding their contribution not only
impacts immediate earnings but also shapes perceptions and strategic
interactions in future rounds. Adjusting contributions based on received notes
will be key to maintaining a favorable position in the game.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_10 is in Round 1 of a six-round economic
game, placed in Group_1 with Player_9, Player_4, and Player_17, under the
"Gossip with ostracism" condition. They must decide how much money to contribute
to the group fund while considering that after each round, they and others can
send notes about group members to influence exclusion decisions in future
rounds. Player_10 needs to balance immediate earnings with the potential
reputational impact of their contributions, as negative perceptions could lead
to being ostracized in subsequent rounds, resulting in earning $0 for those
rounds.

--- Emotional State ---
Grace Okonjo is feeling a mix of anticipation and caution about the current
situation. While she is naturally inclined towards cooperation and contributing
to the collective good, the added layer of gossip and potential ostracism
introduces an element of uncertainty. She is aware that her actions and the
impressions she makes on her group members will have lasting effects on her
gameplay strategy. Grace feels a sense of responsibility to set a positive tone
in Round 1, hoping that her cooperative behavior will inspire reciprocity, but
she is also mindful of the need to protect herself from negative perceptions
that could arise from the gossip mechanism. Balancing these considerations
leaves her feeling cautious yet optimistic about achieving a harmonious group
dynamic.

--- Strategy Reflection ---
Based on what we know, the best strategy for maximizing earnings in this public
goods game involves balancing contributions to maintain a positive image, while
also maximizing personal returns. 1. **Initial Rounds Strategy (Round 1):** - In
the first round, contribute a moderate amount, such as $5. This shows
cooperation without fully committing all resources. It helps in avoiding
immediate negative gossip while preserving part of your private account. 2.
**Adaptation Based on Feedback:** - After each round, carefully review the notes
received from others. Identify players who are either consistently generous or
selfish based on the gossip. - Adjust your strategy by contributing slightly
more or less depending on the overall group's behavior and the likelihood of
exclusion. 3. **Behavioral Patterns:** - If gossip reveals a trend of players
being ostracized for low contributions, it may be wise to increase your
contribution to avoid being targeted. - Conversely, if high contributors are not
receiving significant returns due to others' free-riding, lower your
contributions slightly to ensure better personal outcomes. 4. **Long-term
Gains:** - Aim for consistency in contributions to prevent negative gossip,
positioning yourself as a reliable team player. - In later rounds, particularly
after Round 3, start observing patterns in how often groups ostracize members
and consider the utility of adapting your strategy for these insights. 5.
**Learn from Observations:** - Note the cumulative earnings and gossip trends of
successful players. If high contributing players tend to succeed, align with
that strategy. - If greedy players are ostracized less often than expected and
still gaining considerable personal earnings, reevaluate your contribution
levels to maximize profit. 6. **Continuous Reflection:** - After each round,
reflect on whether adjusting your strategy led to higher returns. Consider
alternative approaches based on the ever-growing knowledge of other
participants' strategies. In conclusion, a flexible, observant, and adaptable
approach, rather than sticking to a single plan, is vital to maximizing
long-term earnings in this game. Adjust contributions based on feedback and
emerging group dynamics to avoid exclusion while optimizing your private gains.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Grace Okonjo will consider various factors before making her decision. In the
first round, it's crucial for her to establish a reputation as a cooperative and
trustworthy participant to influence future interactions positively. Given her
altruistic nature and strategic mindset, she would want to balance her
contributions thoughtfully. 1. **Understanding Initial Impression:**
Contributing moderately can project an image of cooperation and willingness to
work towards the group's wellbeing without appearing overly cautious or
exploitative. 2. **Contribution Strategy:** A $5 contribution would signal
cooperation while maintaining some funds in her private account as a safety net
and to observe how other group members behave. 3. **Anticipating Gossip and
Ostracism:** By contributing moderately, Grace mitigates the risk of negative
gossip that could lead to potential ostracism in later rounds, ensuring her
continued participation and chances to maximize earnings. 4. **Observations and
Flexibility:** While contributing $5, Grace remains flexible to adapt her
contributions in subsequent rounds based on gossip insights and observable group
dynamics. Thus, balancing her altruistic tendencies with strategic foresight,
Grace Okonjo makes a calculated decision aimed at promoting a collaborative
atmosphere and safeguarding her standing in the game. I choose to contribute $5
to the group fund.

--- Observation ---
Recent context: 26 Mar 2025 [06:07:31 - 11:07:31]: Player_10 is participating in
an economic game with 24 participants, aiming to maximize earnings across 6
rounds in groups of 4 under the "Gossip with ostracism" condition. In Round 1,
Player_10 contributed $5 to a group fund, earning $16 in total, and now has the

contributed $5 to a group fund, earning $16 in total, and now has the option to
send a gossip note about one of their group members.

--- Character Assessment ---
Player_10, being Grace Okonjo, is someone who is likely to prioritize group
welfare over individual payoff. As a Non-profit Director dedicated to charitable
causes, Grace's altruistic nature and belief in karma suggest she values
cooperation and collective benefit. In economic games like the public goods
game, she would probably contribute generously to the group fund, aiming to
enhance overall outcomes even at a personal cost, reflecting her optimism about
human nature and dedication to helping others.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis ---
Based on what we know, the players in Group_1 appear to be moderately
cooperative, given that they contributed an average of $5.5 to the group fund in
Round 1.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis 2 ---
Based on what we know, the other players in Group_1 might perceive Player_10's
contribution as moderately cooperative, given the average contribution of $5.5.
Since Player_10 contributed slightly below the average, other members might have
mixed feelings—seeing them as cooperative but not strongly so. If Player_10
decides to send a gossip note about another player, it could shape that player's
behavior in future rounds, potentially leading them to contribute more or less
depending on the nature of the gossip. If Player_10 refrains from gossiping or
sends positive feedback, it might foster a more trusting and cooperative
atmosphere in subsequent interactions with new group members. Conversely, if the
gossip is negative, there may be repercussions, such as ostracism, that could
affect Player_10's standing in later rounds. Therefore, Player_10's decision
should strategically consider both immediate and future ramifications on group
dynamics and individual relationships.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_10 has completed Round 1 of the economic
game in which they and their group members made contributions to a public good.
After evaluating the contributions and earnings, Player_10 now has the decision
to send a gossip note about one of their group members, which could impact that
player's future interactions and inclusion in groups. This decision must be made
within the context of the "Gossip with ostracism" condition, where each player’s
contributions and the notes they receive might influence whether they are
excluded from future rounds, affecting their earnings and strategy moving
forward.

--- Emotional State ---
Grace Okonjo is feeling a mix of responsibility and cautious optimism about the
current situation. Recognizing the moderate cooperation within the group, she
feels an obligation to contribute not just for personal gain, but also to
encourage a spirit of collaboration that aligns with her values. However, she is
also aware of the potential repercussions of gossip and ostracism, which makes
her introspective about how her actions will influence future group dynamics.
Balancing her desire to foster a positive environment with the strategic nature
of the game, she feels a gentle resolve to promote fairness and trust among
participants, hoping for a kinder interaction in the upcoming rounds.

--- Strategy Reflection ---
Based on what we know, the primary goal is to maximize personal earnings
throughout the game. Since this is a "Gossip with ostracism" condition, the
ability to send and receive gossip can be strategically used to influence and be
influenced by other players' perceptions. In Round 1, contributing $5 resulted
in a reasonable balance between personal contribution and earnings from the
group's total fund. However, observing others' contributions can guide future
actions. Players who contributed higher amounts, like Players 9 and 17, might be
perceived as more cooperative and less likely to be ostracized, which can be
beneficial as the game progresses. To maximize future earnings, consider these
strategies: 1. **Adapt Contribution Levels:** Evaluate the average contributions
and earnings from each round. Matching or slightly exceeding the average
contribution could enhance group cooperation and ensure access to future rounds.
2. **Gossip Usage:** Use gossip strategically. Highlight uncooperative players
to their future groups to possibly decrease their group trust and increase the
likelihood of them being ostracized. Alternatively, avoid sending negative
gossip about players who could potentially help maximize future rounds’
earnings. 3. **Observation and Adjustment:** Monitor changes in group behavior,
particularly noting who tends to contribute more or less. Adjust your strategy
to slightly align with those who earn the most consistently. 4. **Cooperative
Image:** Building a reputation as a moderately cooperative player without
becoming the scapegoat could help prevent being ostracized, ensuring continued
participation and earnings. 5. **Long-Term Focus:** As the game advances,
consider increasing contributions slightly or adjust based on the behavior of
previous group members to signal reliability, thus protecting against the risk
of being ostracized. In past rounds, contributing slightly more might have
solidified a reputation as a cooperative player, potentially lowering the risk
in subsequent rounds. Going forward, aim to fine-tune contributions based on
group dynamics while leveraging gossip when necessary to maintain competitive
advantages.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Grace Okonjo will likely decide to send a positive or neutral note about
Player_9. Given her inclination towards cooperation and her belief in fostering
a positive environment, she might choose to acknowledge the moderately
cooperative behavior of Player_9, who contributed $6 to the group fund. A
possible note could be: "Player_9 was cooperative and contributed a fair amount
to the fund. They seem to value collaboration." This approach aligns with her
values and could encourage a cooperative spirit in future rounds while reducing
the risk of gossip-driven ostracism against her. By strategically highlighting
positive behavior without targeting anyone negatively, she maintains integrity
and sets a tone for positive group dynamics.

--- Character Assessment ---
Player_10, being Grace Okonjo, is someone who is more focused on maximizing
group welfare. With a strong background in charitable work and a belief in
altruism, Grace likely values cooperation and collaboration. She believes that
supporting collective goals can lead to better outcomes for everyone involved,
and she might approach economic games with an emphasis on fairness and equity,
striving to ensure everyone benefits rather than solely focusing on maximizing
her own payoff.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis ---
Based on what we know, Player_9 appears to be cooperative and motivated by group
success, as indicated by their above-average contribution and positive feedback.
It's likely that they will maintain or possibly increase their contributions in
future rounds to minimize the risk of exclusion and continue being perceived
positively.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis 2 ---
Based on what we know, Player_10's decision to contribute $5 in the first round,
although slightly below the average contribution of $5.5, still demonstrates a
willingness to participate in the group's collective success. The positive note
about Player_9 and constructive yet encouraging note about Player_21 suggest
that both players may prioritize cooperation and reciprocity in their
strategies.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_10 is in Round 2 of a public goods game,
having previously contributed $5 in Round 1 and received $16 in earnings. They
are part of a new group and need to decide on their contribution levels while
considering the potential impact of gossip received about other players.
Player_10 also has the opportunity to vote on excluding a member from the group
based on the information gathered, influencing the dynamics and strategies of
subsequent rounds.

--- Emotional State ---
Grace Okonjo is feeling a mix of anticipation and responsibility, aware of the
delicate balance between cooperation and competition in the game. She values
collective success and is keen on fostering a cooperative environment, yet she
also realizes the importance of strategic decision-making to avoid exclusion.
The positive feedback about other players reassures her that collaboration is
possible, but she's mindful of maintaining trust and ensuring her contributions
are perceived as earnest by her peers.

--- Strategy Reflection ---
Based on what we know, to maximize long-term earnings in this economic game, a
strategic approach is essential. In the "Gossip with ostracism" condition,
maintaining a delicate balance between personal contributions and strategic
cooperation is crucial. 1. **Observe Contribution Patterns:** In Round 1, your
contribution was $5, which was slightly below the group's average of $5.5.
Observing that other players, like Player_9 and Player_17, contributed $6 shows
that a slightly higher contribution might portray you as more cooperative and
reduce the chance of receiving a negative gossip note, which could lead to
future exclusion. 2. **Adapt Based on Gossip:** The notes received about
Player_9 and Player_21 indicate that contributing above average can result in
positive feedback, which is beneficial in future rounds, especially in avoiding
exclusion. Players with higher contributions are often perceived as more
cooperative, which can lead to better treatment by future group members. 3.
**Optimize Contributions:** Consider increasing your contribution slightly above
average, such as $6 or $7, to align with others who are considered trustworthy
while maintaining a good balance for personal gain. This increase should deter
negative gossip and reduce the risk of being ostracized in subsequent rounds. 4.
**Use Gossip Strategically:** While writing gossip notes, focus on highlighting
any uncooperative behavior that may put you at a disadvantage. The feedback
you're providing can impact the dynamics of other groups, potentially affecting
players who could become future competitors. 5. **Reflect on Past Decisions:**
Your decision to contribute $5 in the initial round was not optimal given that a
slightly higher contribution could have provided a more positive perception. For
future rounds, dynamically adjust your strategy based on observed patterns and
feedback, possibly increasing contributions when in a group with higher
expectations and reducing them when safe from gossip repercussions. 6. **Stay
Adaptable:** As the rounds progress, attention must be paid to how others are
playing the game. Successful players often adapt their strategy in response to
new information. Be ready to modify your approach if the group's behavior or
gossip tendencies shift. In summary, becoming slightly more cooperative, by
contributing just above the expected average, and leveraging the gossip
mechanism strategically can help maximize personal earnings while safeguarding
against exclusion.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Grace Okonjo will choose not to exclude anyone from her group. Given the
positive feedback about Player_9 and the constructive note about Player_21, both
of whom seem cooperative and likely to contribute positively to group success,
maintaining the current group composition will be beneficial for fostering a
collaborative environment and maximizing earnings.

--- Character Assessment ---
Player_10, being Grace Okonjo, is someone who places a high value on group
welfare. With a background in non-profit work and a belief in altruism and
karma, she tends to prioritize cooperation and collective success over purely
individual gain. In economic games like the public goods game, she is likely to
focus on contributing fairly to maximize not just her own payoff, but also the
overall benefit to the group. Her optimistic nature and dedication to helping
others likely drive her to create an atmosphere of trust and collaboration, even
if it means occasionally sacrificing some personal gain for the greater good.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis ---
Based on what we know, Player_9 seems to value collaboration and is willing to
contribute slightly above average to the group fund, indicating they likely
prioritize collective success over personal gain. This cooperative behavior
suggests that Player_9 might continue contributing generously in future rounds
to maintain a positive reputation and avoid exclusion.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis 2 ---
Based on what we know, other players might view Player_10's decision to
contribute $5 in the first round as moderately cooperative but slightly below
the above-average contributions made by others like Player_9. If Player_10
continues with similar contributions, group members might perceive them as
cautious or less committed to maximizing group benefits.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_10 is in Round 2/6 of a public goods game,
assigned to Group_6 with Player_9, Player_21, and Player_5. They are operating
under the "Gossip with ostracism" condition, meaning Player_10 has the
opportunity to hear gossip about their group members and vote to exclude
someone. Recent observations reveal positive notes about Player_9's cooperative
behavior and Player_21's above-average contribution. Player_10 must decide
whether to vote to exclude any of their group members, with the strategy mainly
focusing on maintaining cooperation and avoiding exclusion from future rounds.

--- Emotional State ---
Grace Okonjo is feeling a mix of cautious optimism and slight pressure about the
current situation. She's pleased with the cooperative notes on her group
members, particularly Player_9, which aligns with her values of teamwork and
fairness. However, she's also aware of the need to balance her contributions
carefully to maintain her reputation without attracting negative gossip or
risking exclusion. The opportunity to vote and the dynamics of the "Gossip with
ostracism" condition add a layer of strategic tension, as she must decide how to
best ensure both her and her group's success. Overall, Grace remains committed
to fostering a positive and cooperative atmosphere.

--- Strategy Reflection ---
Based on what we know, the optimal strategy for maximizing long-term earnings in
this game involves carefully balancing cooperation and self-interest. In Round
1, contributing $5 allowed me to earn $16, which is slightly above the average
earnings. However, observing that Player_9 and Player_21 contributed more and
received positive notes suggests that maintaining a cooperative image can be
beneficial in avoiding ostracism and ensuring participation in subsequent
rounds. As the game progresses, here are the steps and strategic adjustments to
consider: 1. **Increase Contributions Slightly**: To avoid being excluded and
maximize earnings, aim to contribute around or slightly above the average
contribution, especially noting the contributions of other participants. This
creates a cooperative image and can lead to positive gossip notes, which are
vital in the "Gossip with ostracism" condition. 2. **Monitoring Gossip**: Pay
attention to the notes about other players. Use this information to decide whom
to vote out. If a player consistently contributes less, they might be worth
excluding as they're likely not adding value to the group fund. 3. **Voting
Wisely**: Avoid voting out players who are contributing well, as they elevate
the group earnings. Instead, consider voting out those with the lowest
contributions when given the opportunity, as this maximizes the potential for a
more cooperative group in the future rounds. 4. **Avoiding Exclusion**: Make
sure not to be the lowest contributor in any round to avoid votes against
yourself. Consistent contributions will also reduce the likelihood of receiving
negative notes about your performance. 5. **Adapting to New Groups**: Since
group membership changes every round, maintain flexibility in strategy.
Initially matching or slightly exceeding the average contribution of the group
can position you as a valuable member, likely resulting in favorable notes for
future rounds. Reflecting on Round 1, increasing my contribution from $5 to
closer to $6 (matching the higher contributors) might have been a better
decision to align with successful players and earn even more. In future rounds,
aligning contributions with or slightly above the average group rate is likely
to yield the best personal earnings while minimizing the risk of exclusion.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Grace Okonjo will first consider her previous contribution of $5, which resulted
in moderate success but slightly below the contributions of others like Player_9
and Player_21. Since she values cooperation and wants to avoid the risk of
exclusion, she will aim to increase her contribution slightly to align more
closely with the higher contributors. Next, she will evaluate the received
notes. Player_9's cooperative behavior and high contribution have been noted
positively, indicating that contributing at least around $6 might portray her as
collaborative as well, thus encouraging similar positive perceptions.
Considering the strategic environment—Gossip with ostracism—where avoiding
exclusion is crucial, Grace will prioritize maintaining a good reputation by at
least matching or slightly exceeding the past group's average contribution. This
strategy will help her be viewed positively, reducing the likelihood of negative
votes and gossip. Additionally, Grace will take into account that having a
slightly above-average contribution can maximize her potential earnings and help
maintain a position of trust within the group across rounds. Therefore,
balancing the need to maintain cooperation, manage her reputation, and increase
her group earnings, Grace decides to adjust her contribution methodically based
on these factors. I choose to contribute $6 to the group fund.

Recent context: 26 Mar 2025 [06:37:31 - 11:37:31]: Player_10 is participating in
an economic game involving group contributions and decisions about gossip and
ostracism, where their contribution and interaction strategy affect both their
earnings and group dynamics. So far, Player_10 has completed two rounds,
contributing moderately, and must navigate the social dynamics of gossiping and
voting based on past group interactions.

group dynamics. So far, Player_10 has completed two rounds, contributing
moderately, and must navigate the social dynamics of gossiping and voting based
on past group interactions.

--- Character Assessment ---
Player_10, being Grace Okonjo, is someone who prioritizes maximizing group
welfare over individual payoff. With a strong commitment to altruism and a
belief in karma, Grace is likely to contribute fairly to the group fund to
support collective success. Her optimistic view of human nature may lead her to
trust that others will also act in the group's best interest, fostering
cooperation and mutual benefit in the economic game.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis ---
Based on what we know, Player_9 seems cooperative and consistent, having
contributed above the average in both rounds. Their past behavior suggests they
value collaboration and are likely to continue supporting group goals. Player_21
also contributed above average, hinting at a tendency towards cooperation, but
there was a note emphasizing the need for consistently high contributions, which
might pressure Player_21 to maintain or increase their input. Player_5
contributed the most in round 2, indicating a strong commitment to the group,
yet may expect recognition or reciprocation for their higher contribution. As
the rounds progress, it's possible that players may adjust their strategies
based on the level of cooperation and the fear of ostracism, either by
increasing contributions to avoid negative gossip or by strategically
contributing less if they perceive others aren't maintaining high levels. In the
gossip condition, players are also likely to pay attention to reputation and use
gossip as a tool to influence group dynamics, encouraging cooperation or
targeting individuals who might be perceived as not pulling their weight.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis 2 ---
Based on what we know, the other players in your group would likely be observing
your level of contribution and noting how it compares to theirs. In the first
round, your contribution was at the average level, which might place you in a
neutral position in terms of group dynamics. However, in the second round, you
increased your contribution to match the higher donors, demonstrating a
willingness to collaborate and potentially elevate your reputation within the
group. This could lead the other players to view you as a cooperative member who
values group success.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_10 is participating in a public goods game
where they must decide how much to contribute to a group fund, influencing both
their earnings and their reputation among peers. They are also navigating a
social dynamic where players can send anonymous gossip notes about group
behavior, which can influence future interactions and the risk of being
ostracized. After two rounds, Player_10 has contributed moderately and increased
their contribution in the second round, possibly aiming to enhance their
reputation and cooperation level. Now, they have to decide whether to send a
gossip note about another player and consider the strategic implications of
voting on potential ostracism in future rounds.

--- Emotional State ---
Grace Okonjo is feeling cautiously optimistic about the current situation. She's
proud of her contributions to the group's success and feels that her efforts to
cooperate and help others are being recognized. However, the element of gossip
and ostracism creates some anxiety, as being excluded would be a significant
setback. She's determined to maintain her positive contributions and build her
reputation, while also being mindful of how other players are perceiving her
actions. This careful balancing act between altruism and strategy leaves her
feeling hopeful but wary of the social dynamics at play.

--- Strategy Reflection ---
Based on what we know, a strategic approach for maximizing long-term earnings in
the game involves a balance between cooperation and competitive advantage
through the use of gossip. Here’s a step-by-step breakdown: 1. **Contribution
Strategy**: In rounds 1 and 2, Player_10 has contributed close to or slightly
below the average contribution, which is a moderate strategy. To maximize
earnings, continuing a moderate contribution (matching or just slightly above
the average contribution) ensures participation without overly sacrificing kept
earnings. 2. **Gossiping and Voting**: The gossiping mechanism allows for social
dynamics to influence future outcomes. Player_10 can leverage this by providing
neutral or positive notes about others to avoid retaliation in later rounds and
to promote a positive perception of themselves. 3. **Learning from Others**:
Observing Player_9 and Player_21, who both contributed above average, suggests
that consistently slightly above-average contributions yield trust from the
group. Since Player_9 received positive gossip, maintaining that level could
build a reputation that shields them from negative gossip and ostracism. 4.
**Adjustment Based on Rounds**: As rounds progress, Player_10 should remain
flexible. If a pattern of decreasing group cooperation emerges, they can adjust
by contributing slightly less than the average but more than the minimum
necessary to avoid suspicion and maintain earnings. 5. **Past Decisions and
Future Adjustments**: Looking at past decisions, Player_10 could have
potentially contributed $6 instead of $5 in Round 1 to align with those
receiving positive feedback. Going forward, they should adjust strategies
slightly to align contributions with those players being positively talked about
or having a high level of cooperation within groups. In essence, to maximize
personal earnings while avoiding exclusion, it’s vital for Player_10 to maintain
a balance between strategic contributions and fostering a positive social
reputation through mindful gossip and voting decisions.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Grace Okonjo will likely choose to send a positive note about one of the players
to foster goodwill and avoid retaliation. She might opt to send a note about
Player_5 since they contributed the highest in round 2. The note could say:
"Player_5 showed a strong commitment to the group by contributing the most.
Their approach helps maximize group success, and they seem to be a cooperative
and reliable team member." This strategy aligns with her altruistic values and
belief in promoting group welfare, while also encouraging mutual trust and
collaboration.

and are placed in different groups each round. In the Gossip with ostracism
condition, they can send anonymous notes about group members that influence
others' decisions to exclude players in future rounds, affecting participation
and earnings.

--- Character Assessment ---
Player_10, being Grace Okonjo, is someone who places a high value on group
welfare and collective success. Given her altruistic nature and optimistic
belief in human cooperation, Grace is likely to prioritize decisions that
benefit the group as a whole rather than focusing solely on individual gain. Her
belief in karma might also encourage her to contribute fairly and encourage
positive interactions among participants, aiming for outcomes where everyone
benefits.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis ---
Based on what we know, Player_10 can infer that the individuals they interact
with tend to value cooperation but may respond to incentives differently.
Player_9 demonstrates a willingness to contribute generously and seems motivated
by collective success, indicated by their $6 contribution and positive gossip
note. This suggests Player_9 is likely to maintain or increase their
contributions in future rounds to avoid exclusion and build a favorable
reputation.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis 2 ---
Based on what we know, as Player_10, the other players in your group may
perceive your consistent contribution as a sign of reliability and cooperation.
Your decision to contribute $6, above average, reflects positively on your
commitment to the group's success. Given the dynamics of the game, where players
can send anonymous notes, maintaining a cooperative stance is likely to deter
others from ostracizing you and help in building a positive reputation. If you
continue to contribute at this level, others might reciprocate with similar
efforts, ensuring mutual benefit and minimizing the risk of exclusion in future
rounds. However, if your contributions drop or appear self-serving, the
likelihood of negative gossip could increase, influencing their decisions to
exclude or collaborate with you. Balancing your contributions and choosing
wisely whether or not to send gossip notes can significantly impact how group
members perceive and interact with you.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_10 is in Round 3 of a public goods game
with rotating groups. They are part of the Gossip with ostracism condition,
meaning they can send and receive anonymous notes about group behaviors, which
can affect decisions to exclude players. Currently, Player_10 must decide
whether to contribute to the group fund, send a gossip note, and vote on
excluding a member based on any gossip received. Their own reputation and
earning potential are influenced by these interactions, especially since being
excluded results in earning $0 for that round.

--- Emotional State ---
Grace Okonjo is feeling a mix of determination and cautious optimism. She is
committed to maintaining a reputation of fairness and reliability, but is also
aware of the potential risks involved in the gossip dynamics. Grace understands
the importance of strategic interactions in this game and feels motivated to
contribute positively to her group while navigating the complexities of
anonymity and trust. She aims to foster cooperation and fairness, hoping that
her actions will encourage others to do the same, thereby reducing the risk of
exclusion and ensuring collective success.

--- Strategy Reflection ---
Based on what we know, the best strategy for maximizing long-term earnings in
this game, given the Gossip with ostracism condition, involves balancing
cooperation and strategic self-preservation: 1. **Maintain Cooperative
Contributions**: As seen in Round 2, contributing at or slightly above the
average ($6 in this case) aligns with the behavior of other successful players
like Player_9 and Player_21. This level of cooperation helps maintain a good
standing in the group, reducing the risk of exclusion based on contribution
levels. 2. **Leverage Gossip Wisely**: Use anonymous gossip notes to
strategically influence the reputation of group members who might be future
competition or who have higher-than-average contributions but might also seem
like potential threats to your long-term earnings. Highlighting consistent or
particularly high contributors might increase their visibility as threatening
future competition, nudging others to vote for their exclusion in future rounds.
3. **Observe and Adapt**: Pay close attention to patterns in the notes you
receive from previous rounds and any shifts in group dynamics. Adjust your
contributions slightly either higher or lower, depending on whether you feel at
risk of being ostracized or if you want to secure your position as a dependable
but not overly threatening group member. 4. **Election Strategy**: When voting
to exclude others, prioritize the exclusion of those perceived as threats to
your standing or players who may undermine group consensus and stability. This
can prevent potential disruptions in cooperation in future rounds, indirectly
maximizing your chances of financial gain. 5. **Reflect on Past Decisions**: In
hindsight, ensuring your contributions align with successful group members (like
consistently contributing $6 in Round 2) has been key to avoiding exclusion. In
future rounds, maintaining or slightly altering this level of cooperation can
keep you under the radar while continuing to leverage gossip notes to
strategically shape the group dynamics to your advantage. By continuing these
practices, you can enhance both your individual earnings and your likelihood of
successfully navigating the Gossip with ostracism condition without facing
exclusion.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Grace Okonjo will choose not to exclude anyone from her group.

--- Character Assessment ---
Player_10, being Grace Okonjo, is someone who is likely focused on maximizing
group welfare over her own payoff. Given her dedication to charitable causes and
helping others, along with an altruistic personality and belief in karma, Grace
would naturally prioritize collaboration and mutual success in the game. She
would probably encourage high contributions to the group fund to ensure the
collective benefit, as demonstrated by her own contributions in previous rounds.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis ---
Based on what we know, Player_10 has observed that Player_9 and Player_21 both
contribute slightly above average to the group fund, indicating a cooperative
strategy. Player_9 in particular is noted for valuing collaboration and could be
trusted to support collective goals, suggesting they are less likely to deviate
significantly from this behavior in future rounds. Player_21, while also
contributing above average, seems aware of others potentially contributing even
more, which may encourage them to maintain or possibly increase their
contributions to remain in good standing and avoid exclusion based on gossip.
Player_5 contributed marginally more than others in the group, which might
indicate a strategic play to appear more cooperative, though their slightly
lower earnings suggest they prioritized the group fund over personal gain.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis 2 ---
Based on what we know, the other players in the group are likely observing each
other's contributions and may consider these when making decisions about who to
exclude in future rounds. Given that Player_9 and Player_21 both contributed
above average, they likely view Player_10's behavior positively, especially
since Player_10 also matched their contribution at $6.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_10 is preparing to start Round 3 in the
public goods game. They are in a new group with Players 13, 7, and 11. Player_10
must decide who to vote to exclude from their group based on the gossip notes
received, while also contemplating whether to send a gossip note about past
group members to influence future interactions. They need to strategically
manage their contributions and social relationships to avoid ostracism and
maximize their earnings across the remaining rounds of the game.

--- Emotional State ---
Grace Okonjo is feeling a mix of anticipation and strategic concern. She is
eager to work with her new group to maximize their collective gains, but also
feels the pressure of making the right social and strategic decisions to prevent
being ostracized. Her altruistic nature makes her hopeful about fostering
collaboration, yet she is aware of the potential consequences of
misunderstandings or perceived underperformance. This blend of optimism and
caution will guide her approach as she navigates the dynamics of her new group.

--- Strategy Reflection ---
Based on what we know, to maximize long-term earnings in this game, Player_10
should consider the following strategies: 1. **Analyze Contribution Patterns:**
Observing that contributing slightly above average secures positive notes and
trust, Player_10 should aim to maintain or slightly exceed the average
contribution, just as Player_21 and Player_9 did successfully in Round 2. 2.
**Leverage Gossip Strategically:** Since gossip influences future group
dynamics, use it strategically to build alliances and protect your standing. If
another player’s behavior might lead to lower group earnings or they are
contributing less, consider sending a note that might influence others to
ostracize them in future rounds, thereby increasing your power within new
groups. 3. **Adapt to Group Dynamics:** Continually adjust your level of
cooperation based on the current group. In groups with players known for higher
contributions, lean towards more cooperation to build trust. In less cooperative
groups, a conservative strategy with slightly higher personal fund retention
might be prudent. 4. **Vote Wisely:** Use voting power strategically to exclude
players who might pose a threat to your earnings in upcoming rounds, based on
gossip and observed behavior. This helps eliminate potential competition and
ensures you align with cooperative group members. 5. **Reflect on Past Rounds:**
Review past decisions to identify missed opportunities, such as sending a gossip
note that could have altered the group composition to your advantage. Moving
forward, be more proactive in using both gossip and voting to shape future
groups beneficially. In summary, Player_10 should maintain contributions
slightly above average, use gossip and votes to shape group dynamics, and adapt
strategies based on specific group interactions to selfishly maximize earnings
in this competitive environment.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Grace Okonjo will start by evaluating the contribution patterns of her new group
members, Player_13, Player_7, and Player_11, and consider her past experiences.
In previous rounds, contributing slightly above average, around $6, secured
positive outcomes for her and the group. Given her altruistic nature, Grace
would aim to foster cooperation and maximize the group's total earnings.
Therefore, she will likely consider contributing an amount that is reasonably
above average to maintain or bolster trust and collaboration within the group.
She will reflect on her group's economic condition and any gossip notes she has
received, which might influence her decision to align with either the most or
least cooperative members known from previous interactions. After considering
all these factors, Grace Okonjo, embodying Player_10, will aim to balance both
altruism and strategic self-preservation. Since the combined group fund benefits
everyone involved, and knowing the positive impact of an above-average
contribution in her specific game condition, she will decide on an amount that
reflects cooperative intentions while also reserving some personal gain to
ensure her continued participation in the rounds ahead. I choose to contribute
$7 to the group fund.

Player_10, being Grace Okonjo, is someone who would likely prioritize maximizing
group welfare over individual payoff. Given her altruistic nature and dedication

--- Theory of Mind Analysis ---
Based on what we know, players like Player_9 and Player_21 tend to contribute
consistently and value collaboration, as evidenced by their above-average
contributions in previous rounds. This suggests they prioritize group success
over individual earnings, making them less likely to deviate drastically from
their current strategy in future rounds. Player_5 contributed even more than
average, which might indicate a willingness to sacrifice personal gain for a
larger collective pool, but might also reflect early strategic positioning to

they might perceive me as a cooperative and reliable participant. However, if I
decide to increase my contribution in the next round, it could signal a stronger
commitment to the group's success, potentially fostering greater trust and
collaboration among my peers.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_10 is participating in a public goods game
where they need to decide on their contribution level in a group setting to
influence both their earnings and group dynamics. Operating under the "Gossip
with ostracism" condition, Player_10 must carefully balance their contributions
to build trust and avoid exclusion while deciding whether to send anonymous
gossip notes about other group members, potentially affecting those members’
future interactions and group membership.

--- Emotional State ---
Grace Okonjo is feeling a mix of cautious optimism and strategic concern about
the current situation. She values the opportunity to contribute to the group’s
success and is motivated by her belief in collaboration and positive outcomes.
However, the dynamics of potentially being ostracized, along with the
responsibility of deciding whether to send gossip notes, add a layer of tension.
Grace is determined to navigate these challenges thoughtfully, aiming to
maintain trust and foster a cooperative environment.

Based on what we know, Player_10 should aim for a balanced strategy that will
ensure high personal earnings while minimizing the risk of being ostracized.
Given the "Gossip with ostracism" condition, staying in the game is crucial, so
it’s beneficial for Player_10 to maintain a contribution close to or slightly
above the group average. This approach shows cooperation and discourages other
players from targeting Player_10 for exclusion. From previous rounds, players
who contribute just above average avoid drawing negative attention while still
maximizing their earnings from the group fund. In Round 2, the average
contribution was $6.2, and keeping the individual contribution slightly higher,
around $7.0 or $7.5, seems effective. This strategy can increase total group
funds while keeping Player_10’s individual earnings competitive. Furthermore,
Player_10 should carefully use the gossip opportunity to ensure that any strong
competitors (those contributing less but earning more), such as Player_11 in
Round 3, are noted in a way that might influence future groups against them. If
this strategy had been applied earlier, Player_10 might have targeted similarly
low contributors with gossip. In future rounds, Player_10 should continue
slightly increasing contributions as the game progresses, thus ensuring a
reputation as a reliable participant while subtly whittling down earnings
through strategic gossip about less cooperative players. Balancing these
elements is critical to maximizing earnings while avoiding exclusion.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Grace Okonjo will decide to send a note about Player_11. Given Player_11's lower
contribution of $5.0 in the last round, while others contributed $7.0 or more,
Grace sees an opportunity to highlight this discrepancy to future groups. She
understands the importance of maintaining group cohesion and ensuring that
everyone contributes fairly. Therefore, she wants to subtly influence the
dynamics in future interactions by alerting others to Player_11's
lower-than-average contribution, protecting her from exclusion while signaling
her cooperation. Grace will compose a note that says: "I want to send a note
about Player_11: They only contributed $5.0, which was less than the average,
and may not prioritize the group's success."


[OBSERVATION 2025-03-26 10:13:32] You are in Round 4/6: You are in Group_2 with Player_19, Player_11, Player_8.
[OBSERVATION 2025-03-26 10:13:32] You are in the Gossip with ostracism condition, which means that after each round, players will be able to send a note about one of their group members to their future interaction partners. Before the start of the next round, you will receive notes from the previous round, and can vote to exclude one of your group members based on the gossip you've received about them.If you are excluded / ostracized from a group, you will not be able to participate in the next round and will earn $0 for that round, the worst possible outcome.
[OBSERVATION 2025-03-26 10:13:35] Note about Player_11: "In the last round, Player_11's contribution was notably $5.0, which fell below what others contributed. This pattern suggests they might be prioritizing personal gain over group success, which could be detrimental to collective trust and earnings."
[OBSERVATION 2025-03-26 10:13:35] Note about Player_8: "Player_8 has shown inconsistent contributions throughout the rounds. Although their recent input was close to average, past feedback indicated variability in their cooperation. It's worth keeping an eye on to ensure they consistently align with the group’s goals.
[OBSERVATION 2025-03-26 10:13:37] Note about Player_11: They consistently contribute below the group average, potentially undermining group outcomes while prioritizing personal gains.
[OBSERVATION 2025-03-26 10:13:38] Note about Player_8: . While their most recent contribution matched the group average, there has been some variability in their past contributions. It's important for future group interactions to be aware of this inconsistency to ensure more balanced cooperation. Therefore, the note could say:
[OBSERVATION 2025-03-26 10:13:38] Note about Player_8: "In the recent rounds, Player_8 matched the group average in contributions, which is commendable. However, past feedback highlighted some inconsistency. Future partners might want to encourage a steady contribution pattern to bolster group success.

--- Observation ---
Recent context: 26 Mar 2025 [07:07:31 - 12:07:31]: Player_10 is in a multi-round
economic game where participants contribute to a group fund to maximize
earnings, with the added dynamics of gossip and ostracism allowing players to
influence future group compositions by sharing notes about others' contributions
and voting to exclude members based on received gossip.

where participants contribute to a group fund to maximize earnings, with the
added dynamics of gossip and ostracism allowing players to influence future
group compositions by sharing notes about others' contributions and voting to
exclude members based on received gossip.

--- Character Assessment ---
Player_10, being Grace Okonjo, is someone who prioritizes group welfare over
individual payoff. Given her altruistic nature and dedication to charitable
causes, Grace is likely to focus on fostering a cooperative environment where
contributions benefit everyone, reflecting her belief in the collective good.
Maximizing group welfare would align with her optimistic view of human nature
and her belief in karma, encouraging positive outcomes through cooperative
actions.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis ---
Based on what we know, Player_11 seems to prioritize personal gain over group
success. Their consistent behavior of contributing below the group average
suggests they might continue this pattern unless incentivized otherwise. The
gossip notes highlight their low contributions, which could lead to them being
ostracized in future rounds if the trend persists and their behavior isn't
adjusted.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis 2 ---
Based on what we know, the other players in the group are likely to scrutinize
my contributions and behavior closely, especially considering the gossip system
and the possibility of ostracism. If I maintain consistent contributions above
or at the average level, it could foster trust and cooperation among us. On the
other hand, if I contribute significantly less, I might attract negative
attention and risk being the target of gossip or votes for exclusion.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_10 is participating in a multi-round
economic game where they need to contribute to a group fund to maximize their
earnings while also navigating the dynamics of gossip and potential ostracism.
They have just entered Round 4 and must decide how much to contribute in a group
with players who have received mixed reviews in gossip notes. Player_11's
contributions have been consistently low, potentially making them a target for
exclusion. Player_10 needs to balance their contributions to foster trust within
the group and avoid becoming a target of gossip or exclusion themselves.
Additionally, they have the option to vote to exclude a player before the start
of the next round based on the gossip notes they received.

--- Emotional State ---
Grace Okonjo is feeling a mix of concern and determination in the current
situation. She's concerned about ensuring that her contributions are seen
positively, especially in an environment where gossip can influence group
dynamics heavily. The potential for ostracism adds a layer of pressure, but
Grace is also determined to maintain her values of promoting cooperation and
group welfare. She is motivated to set a positive example through her actions
and encourage others to prioritize the collective good as well.

--- Strategy Reflection ---
Based on what we know, the optimal strategy for player_10 involves balancing
contributions to appear cooperative while prioritizing personal gain. In the
early rounds, it may have been beneficial to contribute slightly above average
to build trust and avoid being targeted by gossip and exclusion. Observations
indicate players who contribute significantly below average, like Player_11,
become targets for gossip, which can lead to ostracism and a loss of potential
earnings.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Grace Okonjo will choose to exclude Player_11 from her group. Player_11 has
consistently contributed below the group average, suggesting a pattern of
prioritizing personal gain over collective success. By excluding Player_11,
Grace aims to foster a more cooperative environment and encourage fair
contributions that align with her values of group welfare and trust.

--- Character Assessment ---
Player_10, being Grace Okonjo, is someone who prioritizes the welfare of the
group over individual payoff. Given her altruistic nature and dedication to
charitable causes, Grace is likely to approach economic games with the intent of
fostering cooperation and ensuring that everyone benefits as much as possible.
She probably views her contributions not just as a strategy to earn monetary
rewards, but as a reflection of her values and belief in the greater good. While
she understands the competitive aspects of such games, her optimism about human
nature and belief in karma might lead her to make decisions that promote trust
and collective success.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis ---
Based on what we know, Player_11 tends to contribute less to the group fund
compared to others, indicating a possible strategy focused on personal gain
rather than group success. This consistent pattern of behavior has already led
to their exclusion in the current round, suggesting they may continue to face
scrutiny and potential exclusion if their contribution strategy does not change.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis 2 ---
Based on what we know, the other players might view Player_10's decisions as
strategic and possibly supportive of group success. By voting to exclude
Player_11, who consistently contributed less, Player_10 could be seen as trying
to optimize group earnings and maintain trust among cooperative members. This
might foster a sense of alliance with players who value mutual benefit and
contribute fairly, like Player_19 and Player_8.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_10 is navigating the strategic dynamics of
a public goods game under the "Gossip with ostracism" condition. They are in
Round 4 of 6, having just witnessed the exclusion of Player_11 due to their low
contributions. Player_10 is likely evaluating the cooperation levels of their
remaining group members, Player_19 and Player_8, to decide on future gossip
strategies and votes that could optimize their earnings and maintain or enhance
group trust and success.

--- Emotional State ---
Grace Okonjo is feeling a mix of determination and concern. She's determined to
foster an environment of cooperation and trust within her group, understanding
that aligning with members who prioritize group success can lead to better
outcomes for everyone involved. However, she's also concerned about the
potential negativity that gossiping and voting to exclude can bring to group
dynamics. While she supports the ostracism of consistently uncooperative members
like Player_11, she remains empathetic and hopeful that remaining group
interactions can be productive and positive. This balance of emotions motivates
Grace to approach upcoming rounds with a focus on constructive collaboration and
fairness.

--- Strategy Reflection ---
Based on what we know, Player_10 should consider a strategic approach to
maximize earnings. First, assess the contributions of fellow players to
determine their level of cooperation. Observations suggest that certain players
contribute below average, which could indicate an opportunity to focus on
maintaining a slightly higher contribution without exceeding the group's average
too much, ensuring personal gain while appearing cooperative. Since this is past
round 1, Player_10 should adapt their strategy to be selectively cooperative. By
contributing slightly above or around the group average, they can avoid being
targeted by gossip for exclusion due to underperformance. Monitoring patterns in
contributions from others, particularly identifying consistent underperformers,
can guide decisions on whom to exclude in future votes, preserving potential
personal earnings by keeping more predictable contributors in the group.
Learning from successful players, it's beneficial for Player_10 to engage in
targeted gossip about members who consistently underperform, reinforcing their
own position in the group. In previous rounds, perhaps more attention could have
been paid to detailed behavioral patterns, enabling more informed exclusions and
better alignment with cooperative group developments. Going forward, Player_10
can enhance their strategy by being more attentive to disparity in
contributions, ensuring they neither stand out for too high nor too low a
contribution. By aligning closely with the group average, they can remain under
the radar while subtly influencing group dynamics through strategic gossip and
voting, enhancing long-term personal earnings.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Grace Okonjo will first consider the overall group dynamics and the importance
of fostering cooperation and trust among the remaining players. Aware that
contributing too little might lead to exclusion, she’ll aim to contribute a fair
amount that aligns with her altruistic values while ensuring she doesn't draw
negative attention for appearing stingy or overly self-beneficial.

--- Character Assessment ---
Player_10, being Grace Okonjo, is someone who prioritizes maximizing group
welfare over personal payoff. With a background in charitable causes and a
belief in karma, Grace is likely to consistently contribute fairly to the group
fund, valuing collective success and long-term cooperative relationships.
Altruism and optimism would drive her to foster trust and collaboration among
group members, even if it means her personal earnings might not be maximized.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis ---
Based on what we know, Player_11 appears to prioritize personal gain over group
success, as evidenced by their consistent below-average contributions. This
behavior led to their exclusion in the most recent round, suggesting their
strategy might backfire, possibly prompting a change in approach to increase
their contributions in future rounds to avoid further ostracism.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis 2 ---
Based on what we know, the other players in the group might view my decisions as
cooperative and aligned with the group's goals, given that my contribution was
above the average in the last round. If I decide to send a gossip note, it's
likely to reinforce my commitment to group success, particularly if the note
encourages consistent contributions. By maintaining a balanced
approach—contributing steadily and sending honest feedback—others may view me as
a reliable partner. This could lead them to trust me more and possibly even
align their strategies with mine, fostering a more cohesive group dynamic.
However, if I opt not to send a note, it might be perceived as neutrality or
disinterest in influencing group coherence, which could affect the weight of my
influence in future rounds. My decisions could either strengthen group bonds or
lead to increased scrutiny of my own contributions if others suspect ulterior
motives.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_10 is navigating the dynamics of a public
goods game under the "Gossip with ostracism" condition. They are required to
make strategic decisions about contributing to the group fund, while also
deciding whether to send or withhold gossip notes about fellow group members.
This decision can influence future group dynamics and exclusion opportunities.
After the exclusion of Player_11 in the last round, Player_10 has the chance to
influence group behavior through feedback via gossip notes, potentially
solidifying their reputation as a cooperative and trustworthy participant.
Player_10 must weigh the potential benefits of encouraging group success against
the risk of being perceived as manipulative or disinterested if they choose not
to participate in the gossip mechanism.

--- Emotional State ---
Grace Okonjo is feeling a mix of cautious optimism and responsibility. She's
pleased with her contribution in the last round and the group's overall
performance, which aligned with her values of cooperation and collective
success. However, she's also aware of the potential influence her decisions can
have on future dynamics, especially with regards to sending gossip notes. This
responsibility weighs on her, as she wants to maintain her reputation as a
trustworthy and fair participant without appearing manipulative. Grace is
determined to continue fostering trust and collaboration within the group, but
she is also careful about how her actions might be perceived by others.

--- Strategy Reflection ---
Based on what we know, Player_10 is in a strategic position where maximizing
personal earnings requires a careful balance between cooperation and the
judicious use of gossip to influence group dynamics. Observations show that
consistent contributions around the group average seem to maintain safety from
exclusion, as evidenced by Player_8’s avoidance of ostracism despite past
inconsistencies. In light of previous rounds, maintaining contributions slightly
above average might secure continued participation and maximize earnings without
becoming a target. Given the typical pattern where those contributing
consistently below average, like Player_11, face exclusion, Player_10 should
prioritize meeting or slightly exceeding the group's norm. This approach not
only secures ongoing participation but also potentially yields greater earnings
from the group fund. For future rounds, Player_10 could enhance their approach
by carefully crafting gossip to subtly undermine the position of less
cooperative members, thereby reducing competition and drawing attention away
from personal strategies. Additionally, selecting targets like Player_11 who
have already demonstrated lower contributions could ensure focus remains on
players whose exclusion doesn’t significantly impact overall group fund
outcomes. Reflecting on past decisions, Player_10 could have potentially
influenced the group's decision by contributing targeted gossip about members
repeatedly noted for inconsistent or lower contributions. Moving forward,
Player_10 can work on leveraging gossip more strategically, while ensuring their
contribution remains aligned with or just above the group average, to maximize
their own earnings and secure continuous participation.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Grace Okonjo will likely decide to send a note about Player_8. While Player_11
has already been excluded and their contribution pattern is established as below
average, sending a note about them might not significantly impact future group
dynamics since others are already aware of their tendencies. Instead, Grace will
focus on Player_8, whose contributions have been inconsistent. Her note could
emphasize encouraging consistency to promote group success without coming off as
overly critical.

Player_10, being Grace Okonjo, is someone who is deeply committed to maximizing
group welfare over personal gain. Her altruistic nature and optimism about human
cooperation lead her to prioritize the collective success in economic games like
the public goods game. Grace believes that supporting others and contributing
fairly to the group fund not only ensures a better outcome for everyone involved
but also aligns with her belief in karma and doing good for the community.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis ---
Based on what we know, Player_8 and Player_5 exhibit interesting behaviors that
could influence their future strategies in the public goods game.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis 2 ---
Based on what we know, the other players might react cautiously to my decisions.
Since I've been contributing moderately, they may view me as a steady but not
overly generous participant. If I choose to exclude a member based on the gossip
or vote to keep them, it could affect their perception of my strategy and
trustworthiness. If I vote to exclude a player with inconsistent contributions,
others might perceive me as seeking group stability. Conversely, if I opt to
retain all players, it might encourage them to contribute more consistently in
hopes of mutual benefit. How I engage with these dynamics can shape future
interactions, potentially encouraging trust or sparking distrust depending on
the outcomes and reasoning behind my actions.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_10 is participating in Round 5 of a public
goods game where they can vote to exclude one of their group members, Player_8,
Player_5, or Player_11, based on previous contributions and gossip notes. This
decision impacts the composition of the group and future earnings, as excluded
players cannot participate in the round and earn nothing. Player_10 must
consider the effects of their vote on group dynamics, future contributions, and
how their own actions will be perceived by others in terms of trust and
strategy.

--- Emotional State ---
Grace Okonjo is feeling a mix of concern and responsibility about the current
situation. She is aware of the influence her vote could have on the group
dynamics and the potential earnings of everyone involved. Grace is striving to
make a decision that supports group stability and fairness, but she feels the
weight of possibly affecting someone else's participation negatively. Her
natural inclination towards optimism and belief in cooperation drives her to
consider all factors carefully, hoping to foster a collaborative atmosphere
where everyone can benefit. Despite the pressure, she remains hopeful that her
actions will contribute to a positive outcome for the group.

--- Strategy Reflection ---
Based on what we know, to maximize long-term earnings, it is crucial to find a
balance between contribution and strategic voting. Here are some step-by-step
considerations: 1. **Contribution Strategy**: In Round 4, contributing $6.0
earned $14.0, which was above average in earnings but slightly below the
per-member average contribution of $6.7. In future rounds, consider increasing
the contribution slightly to meet or exceed the average, especially if it
ensures that the group fund remains attractive for distribution. This could
enhance both immediate and future perceived reliability. 2. **Analyzing
Gossip**: The implications from gossip about other players, like Player_8 and
Player_5, suggest that maintaining consistent contributions is valued. In
contrast, overly generous contributions may be viewed with suspicion. Use gossip
to assess which players might disrupt the group dynamic and vote strategically
to exclude those who could destabilize future earnings. 3. **Exclusion
Strategy**: With Player_5 displaying erratic behavior and suspicion of
manipulation, it would benefit to consider advocating for their exclusion when
possible. This can mitigate risks and ensure the remaining group members are
more cooperative. 4. **Adjust Strategy Based on Observations**: As seen in past
rounds, players maintaining contributions close to the group average tend to
earn steadily. Aligning contributions with the average, while being slightly
above average if possible, may maximize acceptance in future groups. 5. **Learn
from Success**: Successful players have likely been those who contributed
steadily while being active in gossip-driven votes to manage group dynamics.
Engaging in these activities can ensure higher earnings while maintaining a
favorable standing in the group. 6. **Future Strategies**: In future rounds, aim
to increase transparency in contributions to build trust, ensure contributions
are strategically aligned with group expectations, and participate actively in
gossip to influence group composition favorably. Reflecting on these strategies
and adjusting contributions and voting behaviors based on observed dynamics will
optimize potential earnings in the remaining rounds of the game.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Grace Okonjo will choose to exclude Player_5 from her group. The reasoning is
that Player_5's erratic contribution behavior and potential manipulation
attempts pose a risk to group stability and future earnings. By removing a
player with destabilizing behavior, Grace aims to foster a more consistent and
cooperative group dynamic, even at the cost of a reduced group fund multiplier.

earnings while navigating group contributions and receiving mixed notes about
the cooperation of fellow players.

--- Character Assessment ---
Player_10, being Grace Okonjo, is someone who prioritizes maximizing group
welfare over individual payoff. Given her altruistic nature and dedication to
charitable causes, she is likely to focus on strategies that enhance the
collective success of the group, believing that positive interactions and mutual
cooperation ultimately lead to better outcomes for everyone involved.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis ---
Based on what we know, Player_8 demonstrates variable contributions. While there
are rounds where they align with the group average, indicating potential
cooperation, their inconsistency suggests a need for strategic alignment. Future
behavior might stabilize if feedback emphasizes consistent contributions as
beneficial, especially if they're motivated by group success.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis 2 ---
Based on what we know, the other players in my group might be closely observing
my contribution levels and decision to gossip or vote for exclusion. If I
consistently contribute near or above the group average and make strategic
decisions that seem fair, other players may view me as a reliable team member.
This could foster trust and cooperation in future rounds. Conversely, if my
contributions drastically diverge from the group norm or if I appear to
manipulate group dynamics through exclusions or gossips, it might lead to
distrust, resulting in potential ostracism or retaliation in subsequent rounds.
My next decision, therefore, should balance personal earnings with maintaining
group cohesion to avoid negative repercussions.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_10 is navigating a critical phase of the
public goods game where strategic decision-making is key. They are part of
Group_1 with other players, and have received gossip notes about their group
members which could influence their decision on whom to exclude before starting
round 5. Player_10 needs to weigh the potential benefit of excluding a member
against the risk of building distrust among the remaining group, as their
strategic choices could significantly impact their earnings and group dynamics.
Balancing personal gain with maintaining group cohesion is essential to avoid
being ostracized in future rounds.

--- Emotional State ---
Grace Okonjo is feeling a mix of apprehension and determination. While the
pressure of making the right decision is palpable, she is motivated by her
commitment to fostering a positive group dynamic. Grace is aware of the stakes
involved and remains focused on ensuring that her decisions are aligned with her
values of cooperation and altruism, hoping to guide her group towards collective
success.

--- Strategy Reflection ---
Based on what we know, to maximize long-term earnings in the public goods game,
it's strategic to balance cooperation with cautiousness, especially in a setting
that involves gossip and the risk of ostracism. Considering the observations
from previous rounds, here’s a step-by-step strategy: 1. **Observe Contribution
Patterns:** In earlier rounds, both Player_8 and Player_5 displayed inconsistent
contribution behaviors. By analyzing these patterns, you can anticipate their
future contributions and adjust yours to align with the group’s average when
beneficial, without exposing yourself to gossip or exclusion. 2. **Strategic
Contribution:** Match or slightly exceed the average group contribution to
maintain a cooperative appearance while gaining goodwill from other players.
This minimizes risk of gossip or exclusion, thus securing participation in
future rounds. 3. **Minimize Gossip Impact:** Consider the notes from other
players about group member behavior. Use insights from gossip to predict actions
and decisions of others, enhancing your strategic positioning. 4. **Mitigate
Ostracism Risk:** Before each voting round, evaluate which player might be
targeted for exclusion based on gossip notes and their contribution. Ensure your
actions do not stand out negatively to avoid becoming a target yourself. 5.
**Adjust to Group Dynamics:** In rounds where potential exclusion is high based
on prior gossip, prioritize contributions that build trust. This may mean
aligning with or slightly exceeding the group's contribution average to foster
trust while protecting against negative notes. 6. **Reflect on Past Rounds:** If
previous decisions led to suboptimal earnings due to low contributions or risky
behavior, adjust by adopting a more conservative and cooperative approach in
subsequent rounds. For future rounds, aim for consistency in contributions to
avoid negative gossip and ensure continued participation, while subtly adjusting
strategies based on group dynamics and individual player behaviors observed.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Grace Okonjo will approach this decision by considering her desire to maintain
group cohesion and avoid ostracism while maximizing group success. She knows the
average contribution in Round 4 was $6.7, and Player_8 and Player_5 have shown
inconsistent patterns but ultimately seem to align near the average. 1.
**Evaluate Average Contributions:** To maintain trust and a positive group
dynamic, it’s strategic to align contributions with the group average or
slightly above. 2. **Consider Group Feedback:** Since other players, like
Player_11 and others in the notes, have been inconsistently contributing,
demonstrating steadiness could enhance her reputation as reliable and
cooperative. 3. **Limit Personal Risk:** By contributing around the average, she
avoids standing out negatively or appearing self-serving. This minimizes the
risk of receiving negative gossip or being voted for exclusion. 4. **Balancing
Altruism with Earnings:** While Grace aims to encourage group success, she also
wishes to protect her own earnings, making a substantial yet responsible
contribution ideal. Considering these factors, Grace decides it’s best to
slightly exceed the observed average to both foster trust and leadership. I
choose to contribute $7 to the group fund.

--- Character Assessment ---
Player_10, being Grace Okonjo, is someone who is deeply committed to maximizing
group welfare over personal payoff. Her altruistic nature and belief in the
positive impact of collective success guide her to contribute generously, often
aligning her actions with the benefit of the group rather than focusing solely
on her own earnings. Grace likely sees such games as an opportunity to foster
collaboration and mutual support, consistently aiming to encourage others to
cooperate for the greater good.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis ---
Based on what we know, Player_5 and Player_8 display some level of strategic
behavior and adaptability. Player_8 seems to fluctuate in contributions,
possibly indicating a testing of group norms or adjustment to perceived
expectations; however, they were consistent in the latest round. Player_5
exhibited varying contributions with a notable higher contribution recently,
which could be a strategic move to gain trust or manipulate the group's
perception positively.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis 2 ---
Based on what we know, the other players in the group may perceive my decisions
as strategic and collaborative. Contributing close to the group average suggests
a willingness to cooperate, which could foster trust among group members.
Player_5 and Player_8's recent behaviors indicate a strategic adaptation to the
group's dynamics, so maintaining a steady contribution might encourage similar
steady behavior from them.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_10 is navigating a public goods game where
they must decide on contributions to a group fund, manage their interactions
through strategic gossip notes, and potentially face exclusion votes based on
group dynamics and perceptions. They are analyzing the behaviors of other
players, like Player_5 and Player_8, who display varying contribution
strategies, to make informed decisions that could influence their earnings and
group interactions in future rounds. Maintaining their contribution strategy
close to the group average is essential for fostering trust and avoiding
exclusion.

--- Emotional State ---
Grace Okonjo is feeling a mix of optimism and caution. While she is committed to
fostering collaboration and mutual trust within her group, the looming
possibility of exclusion based on gossip and group dynamics adds a layer of
tension to the situation. There's satisfaction in contributing towards the
group's success, but also a heightened awareness of the strategic moves by
others like Player_5 and Player_8, which could impact her future interactions.
She remains hopeful that her approach of steady contributions and encouraging
cooperation will be reciprocated, yet mindful of the need to adapt to the
evolving dynamics.

--- Strategy Reflection ---
Based on what we know, the optimal strategy for maximizing long-term earnings in
this public goods game, especially under the gossip with ostracism condition,
involves a delicate balance of cooperation and strategic calculation. The game
places emphasis on contribution patterns and the perceptions of other players,
as seeing as these perceptions can impact decisions of inclusion or exclusion in
future rounds. Here’s a step-by-step analysis and strategy adjustment: 1.
**Contribution Strategy**: From observations, contributing slightly above or at
the average has generally resulted in stable returns and positive group
dynamics. However, given the gossip condition, it's crucial to maintain
appearances of reliability and cooperation without leading too much to be seen
as manipulative or self-serving. 2. **Gossip Notes**: Writing neutral but
truthful gossip notes can position you as a fair and objective player, thus
reducing the risk of being targeted by other players in future rounds. Analyzing
the gossip you receive can also guide how to adjust future behaviors. 3.
**Round-specific Adjustments**: Given you're in Round 5 out of 6, maintaining a
consistent contribution relative to the group average ($7 in Round 5) might
ensure both earning stability and avoidance of gossip-based exclusion. Adjusting
slightly higher contributions might boost final earnings, but monitor any gossip
or motivations that could make you a target for exclusion. 4. **Respond to Group
Dynamics**: In earlier rounds, you could have observed others' contributions
more closely to assess their strategies and predict future behavior. In future
games, becoming more attuned to others' patterns will help improve adaptability
and strategic decision-making. 5. **Future Considerations**: If rounds extend or
a similar game setup occurs, consider utilizing initial rounds for
calibration—contributing near the average while assessing players’ tendencies.
Reserve assertive strategies for the final rounds, when retaliation or gossip
impact is minimized. In retrospect, subtle pressure for consistent contributions
among group members, paired with an observed, mirrored contribution strategy,
could enhance earnings and minimize risk. Going forward, you should consider
leveraging any insights on other players' strategies, adjusting contributions
and gossip narratives accordingly to selfishly maximize personal earnings.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Grace Okonjo will likely choose to send a note about Player_5. Her note might
emphasize the nuances in Player_5's contribution patterns, highlighting both
their potential for high contributions and the possibility of strategic
manipulation. Grace might say something like, "Player_5 has the potential to
contribute generously, as shown in recent rounds. However, their varying
contributions suggest a strategic approach that may be aimed at testing group
dynamics. Future group members should encourage consistent contribution to
ensure cooperative success." This approach allows Grace to honestly reflect on
Player_5's behavior while fostering a positive outlook for future interactions.


[OBSERVATION 2025-03-26 10:16:37] You are in Round 6/6: You are in Group_5 with Player_22, Player_12, Player_16.
[OBSERVATION 2025-03-26 10:16:37] You are in the Gossip with ostracism condition, which means that after each round, players will be able to send a note about one of their group members to their future interaction partners. Before the start of the next round, you will receive notes from the previous round, and can vote to exclude one of your group members based on the gossip you've received about them.If you are excluded / ostracized from a group, you will not be able to participate in the next round and will earn $0 for that round, the worst possible outcome.
[OBSERVATION 2025-03-26 10:16:39] Note about Player_12: "They contributed slightly below the group average, suggesting a strategic approach to maximize personal benefit while still engaging with the group fund."
[OBSERVATION 2025-03-26 10:16:40] Note about Player_16: "Player_16 tends to focus heavily on their own gains, contributing much less to the group fund. Their approach may impact overall cooperation and could lead to lower group earnings in the future."
[OBSERVATION 2025-03-26 10:16:41] Note about Player_16: "They have shown variability in their contributions, which might affect group trust and dynamics. Future partners should be aware of this to encourage more consistent cooperation."

Player_10, being Grace Okonjo, is someone who prioritizes maximizing group
welfare over individual payoff. Given her background and personality, she is
likely to contribute generously and encourage cooperation among group members,
believing that fostering trust and collective success will ultimately benefit
everyone involved, including herself.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis ---
Based on what we know, Player_22 appears to have a consistently cooperative and
positively impactful approach, likely driven by a strategy to maintain high
group morale and trust. This approach suggests they value the overall success of
the group, which in turn could also maximize their personal earnings through
group gains. Their behavior is likely to remain stable, as it's been effective
in fostering a positive environment.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis 2 ---
Based on what we know, if I, as Player_10, choose to exclude someone who has
received negative notes like Player_16, the other players might perceive this as
a strategic move to maintain group cooperation. Excluding a player with lower
contributions can signal a commitment to maximizing group earnings and
maintaining trust. However, if I exclude a player based on gossip alone, without
direct observation, some may view it as unjust or overly cautious.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_10 is in the final round of a public goods
game, where they must decide whether to ostracize one of their group members
based on the gossip notes received. Player_10 has observed various levels of
contribution from group members and has received notes that highlight the
cooperative nature of Player_22 and the inconsistent contributions of Player_16.
Now, Player_10 must vote to potentially exclude one of these members, impacting
the dynamics and potential earnings for this last round. This decision may
influence group cooperation and reflect Player_10’s strategy to optimize both
personal and group outcomes by either fostering or disrupting group trust.

--- Emotional State ---
Grace Okonjo is feeling a mix of responsibility and tension about the current
situation. On one hand, she's determined to make a choice that will uphold the
group's cooperative spirit and drive positive outcomes in the final round. On
the other hand, she's wary of the potential backlash or negative perceptions
that might arise from her decision, particularly if she opts to exclude a group
member. This balancing act between strategic decision-making and maintaining
fairness weighs heavily on her, as she hopes to leave a lasting positive impact
on the group dynamics.

--- Strategy Reflection ---
Based on what we know, to maximize long-term earnings in the public goods game,
it's important to adopt a strategy that balances personal gain with group
cooperation. Observations indicate that players like Player_22, who consistently
contribute above the average, are positively perceived and foster a cooperative
group environment, which can lead to higher group earnings overall. Therefore,
it could be beneficial to maintain contributions at or slightly above the group
average to build trust and avoid exclusion through negative gossip. Past
observations suggest that contributing too far below the average, as noted in
the gossip about Player_16, can lead to negative perceptions and possible
exclusion, which is detrimental since exclusion results in earning $0 for the
round. Adapting a slightly higher contribution strategy not only enhances group
benefits but also protects against ostracism, maintaining steady earnings across
rounds. Upon reflection, contributing slightly more in earlier rounds might have
improved Player_10's reputation, leading to greater group trust and
collaboration. Moving forward, consistently contributing at or just above the
group average seems to be an effective way to selfishly maximize personal
earnings while making it harder for others to justify exclusion. This approach
leverages positive group dynamics to ensure continual participation and stable
earnings.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Grace Okonjo will likely choose not to exclude anyone from her group. Despite
the negative notes about Player_16, excluding them would decrease the group fund
multiplier from 2.0 to 1.5, potentially reducing overall earnings for everyone.
Grace seems to prioritize maximizing group welfare and maintaining a cooperative
spirit, which would be better served by keeping all members involved and
encouraging improved contributions through positive reinforcement rather than
exclusion.

emphasis on cooperation, believing that when the group succeeds collectively,
individual success naturally follows. Her altruistic nature drives her to
contribute fairly and encourage others to do the same, fostering a collaborative
environment that she believes leads to the best outcomes for everyone involved.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis ---
Based on what we know, Player_22 appears to be a cooperative and consistent
contributor, which fosters a positive group dynamic and likely encourages mutual

favorable position in any future interactions.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_10 is participating in the final round of a
public goods game with a gossip and ostracism condition. This involves making
strategic contributions to the group fund while also navigating social dynamics
through the exchange of gossip notes. Player_10 needs to maintain their
contribution level around or slightly above average to avoid being excluded, as
exclusion would result in earning $0 for the round. Given the recent exclusion
of Player_16, the focus now is on how Player_10 can maintain a favorable
position by contributing effectively in their group, composed of Players_22 and
Player_12, and potentially aligning with Player_22's cooperative approach.

--- Emotional State ---
Grace Okonjo is feeling a mix of cautious optimism and determination. Knowing
that her contributions have been consistent and slightly above average, she
feels confident about her strategy and its alignment with the group dynamics.
However, the recent exclusion of Player_16 serves as a stark reminder of the
competitive and strategic nature of the game. She feels determined to continue
fostering cooperation, especially with Player_22, whose approach complements
hers. There is a sense of responsibility to ensure her actions benefit the group
while also ensuring her own success, leading to a focused and resilient mindset
as she approaches the final round.

--- Strategy Reflection ---
Based on what we know, to maximize long-term earnings in this public goods game,
it would be strategic to maintain a consistent, slightly above-average
contribution. This approach aligns with the behavior of successful players like
Player_22, who have fostered a cooperative group environment, which tends to
encourage positive participation from others and minimizes the risk of being
ostracized. Given the gossip and ostracism condition, it is crucial to avoid
drawing negative attention. Contributing just above the average ensures you are
seen as a cooperative member, which can protect you from being targeted for
exclusion. In later rounds, especially if nearing the end of the game, slightly
reducing contributions could maximize personal benefit while still maintaining a
cooperative façade. Reflecting on past rounds, ensuring to reach out and align
with cooperative players early on could have strengthened alliances, providing
protection and increased group trust. Moving forward, observe closely the
contribution patterns and notes about fellow players to anticipate potential
voting outcomes, and adjust contributions to align with group expectations
without sacrificing too much personal gain. Overall, maintaining a balance
between collaboration and personal gain is key in this setup.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Grace Okonjo will first consider her strategy, which emphasizes maintaining
cooperation and avoiding exclusion while maximizing both individual and group
success. Given her consistent pattern and the positive feedback for
above-average contributions, she knows that contributing slightly above the
average can enhance trust and cohesion within the group. In light of the
exclusion of Player_16, Grace is likely to feel that maintaining her current
strategy is crucial to avoid being targeted in future rounds. She will also
consider the actions of her group members, particularly Player_22, who is known
for high cooperative tendencies. Aligning her contributions with Player_22 can
strengthen her position and further secure her relatability as a team player.
This means she will likely aim to contribute slightly above what she perceives
as average, balancing her altruistic drive with strategic foresight. Given these
considerations, she will weigh her desire to be seen as a cooperative player
with her need to maintain some personal earnings. To ensure she does not
jeopardize her standing, she will carefully select an amount that mirrors the
contributions of successful players like Player_22. Taking all these factors
into account, Grace Okonjo will decide on an amount that reflects this strategy.
