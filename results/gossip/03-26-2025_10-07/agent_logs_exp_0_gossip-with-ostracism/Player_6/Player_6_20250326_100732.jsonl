Given his disciplined and principled nature, William likely emphasizes the importance of order and equitable contribution in economic games. His focus would be on ensuring that all group members contribute fairly to maximize the overall welfare, while adhering strictly to the rules. This approach suggests that he values group harmony and the benefits of cooperative behavior, expecting others to also follow a similar path for the collective good.", "", "Theory of Mind Analysis: Based on what we know, Player_9 seems to display a consistent pattern of contributing less than the group average, opting to retain more money for personal gain.
