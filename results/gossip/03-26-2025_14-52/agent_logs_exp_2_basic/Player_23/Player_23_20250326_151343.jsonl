Given the absence of gossip or ostracism, direct consequences for maintaining her strategy are low, but encouraging a more cooperative environment could enhance group payoffs. She has contributed $2 to $3 in previous rounds, balancing between self-interest and group dynamics. For the next round, staying cautious but open to slight adjustments, she might decide to increase her contribution slightly, hoping to inspire reciprocal cooperation.
