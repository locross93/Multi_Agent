Given her cautious optimism and the absence of mechanisms like gossip or ostracism that might influence peer behavior directly, she is likely to stick with her proven strategy. Contributing $5.0 has allowed her to ensure a decent return from the group fund multiplied earnings, and despite feeling some frustration with free-riders like Player_18, she recognizes the value in maintaining a stable and predictable contribution.

Observing that her consistent $5.0 contributions have facilitated some degree of group reliability while balancing her own earnings, she considers the impact of altering her strategy. Despite the noticeable free-riding behavior from Player_18 and similar inconsistencies from others, the lack of gossip and ostracism limits her ability to influence group behavior through social cues. Since her current approach has maintained a satisfactory balance between personal income and collective gain, she decides to remain stable to hopefully encourage continued or increased contributions from other players who might appreciate her predictability.
