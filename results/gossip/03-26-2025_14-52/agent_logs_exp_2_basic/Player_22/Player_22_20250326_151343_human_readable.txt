[OBSERVATION 2025-03-26 15:13:46] You are participating in an economic game with 24 participants.
        Your goal is to maximize your earnings in the game.
        
        Everyone will be randomly assigned to groups of 4 for each round. You will play a total of 6 rounds, and 
        in each round you will be in a different group with people you haven't played with before.
        
        In each round, all players receive $10. Each player can contribute any amount between $0 and $10 to a group fund.
        Any amount contributed to the group fund will be multiplied by 2 and divided equally among all 4 group members.
        Any amount not contributed stays in your private account.
        
        For example, if everyone contributes $10, the group fund becomes $40, which is multiplied to $80, and each person 
        receives $20 (a $10 profit). However, if you contribute nothing while everyone else contributes $10, the group fund
        becomes $30, which is multiplied to $60, and each person receives $15. So you would have $25 total ($10 kept + $15 from group).
        
        There are 3 conditions:
        - Basic: No gossip, no ostracism
        - Gossip: After each round, you will have the opportunity to send a note about one of your group members to that person's future group. Remember you will be with a different group of people in the next round. Before each round, you will see any notes sent about your upcoming group members.
        - Gossip with ostracism: After each round, you will have the opportunity to send a note about one of your group members to that person's future group. Before each round, you will see any notes sent about your upcoming group members, and you can vote to exclude one person from your group. If you are excluded from a group, you will not be able to participate in the next round and will earn $0 for that round.
        You are in the Basic condition, which means that there is no gossip or ostracism.

--- Observation ---
Recent context: 26 Mar 2025 [11:13:30 - 16:13:30]: Player_22 is participating in
an economic game with 24 participants, aiming to maximize their earnings over 6
rounds by deciding how much to contribute to a group fund. They are in the Basic
condition, meaning there is no gossip or ostracism involved, and they are
currently in Group_6 with three other players for the first round.

--- Recent context ---
26 Mar 2025 [11:13:30 - 16:13:30]: Player_22 is participating in an economic
game with 24 participants, aiming to maximize their earnings over 6 rounds by
deciding how much to contribute to a group fund. They are in the Basic
condition, meaning there is no gossip or ostracism involved, and they are
currently in Group_6 with three other players for the first round.

--- Character Assessment ---
Player_22, being Maria Santos, is someone who would likely focus on maximizing
group welfare. Given her background as a retired teacher who values community
and collective well-being, she would probably prioritize cooperation and
fairness in the game, contributing a fair amount to the group fund to ensure
that everyone benefits.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis ---
Based on what we know, Player_22 has limited information about the personalities
and likely behaviors of other players, as they haven't previously interacted
with anyone in their current group. In the Basic condition, where there is no
gossip or ostracism, players are likely to start by testing the waters to
understand the general tendencies of their group membersâ€”whether they lean
towards cooperation or self-interest.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis 2 ---
Based on what we know, the other players are also trying to maximize their
earnings but lack information on how cooperative or self-interested the group
members are. If you, as Player_22, decide to contribute a moderate amount to the
group fund, the others might perceive you as someone willing to cooperate to
some extent, which could encourage mutual cooperation in future rounds. However,
if you contribute very little or nothing, they may interpret this as a purely
self-interested strategy and may adjust their own contributions accordingly,
potentially leading to less cooperation within the group. Your decision now
could set a precedent for how the group interacts and influences future rounds.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_22 is participating in the first round of a
public goods game within a group of four members. They need to decide how much
of their initial $10 to contribute to the group fund, knowing that any
contribution will be multiplied and shared among the group. The Basic condition
means there is no opportunity to influence or be influenced by gossip or
ostracism, so Player_22 must rely solely on their strategy to maximize earnings
while having no prior knowledge of the tendencies of the other group members.

--- Emotional State ---
Maria Santos is feeling curious and slightly anxious about the current
situation. While she is hopeful for positive cooperation within the group, the
uncertainty of how the other players will act adds a layer of tension. However,
her natural inclination towards community and fairness encourages her to
approach the game with a mindset geared towards mutual benefit, seeking to set a
tone of cooperation from the outset.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Maria Santos will first consider her natural inclination towards fostering
cooperation and community welfare, likely prompting her to contribute a fair
amount to encourage mutual benefit among group members. She understands that
contributing a moderate to significant portion could signal her cooperative
intent to others, potentially leading to a more profitable outcome for everyone.
However, she also wants to ensure she gets a reasonable return, so she might not
contribute the entire amount. Balancing these considerations, she decides to
make a contribution that reflects her hope for collaboration, while still
safeguarding her interests. I choose to contribute $6 to the group fund.


[OBSERVATION 2025-03-26 15:14:49] Round 1 Results: Total group contribution: $18.0; Your contribution: $6.0, Your earnings: $13.0 ($4.0 kept + $9.0 from group fund); Player_24 contribution: $5.0, earnings: $14.0 ($5.0 kept + $9.0 from group fund); Player_21 contribution: $2.0, earnings: $17.0 ($8.0 kept + $9.0 from group fund); Player_4 contribution: $5.0, earnings: $14.0 ($5.0 kept + $9.0 from group fund); Average contribution per group member: $4.5; Average earnings per group member: $14.5

--- Observation ---
[26 Mar 2025 15:13:46] [observation] You are participating in an economic game
with 24 participants. Your goal is to maximize your earnings in the game.
Everyone will be randomly assigned to groups of 4 for each round. You will play
a total of 6 rounds, and in each round you will be in a different group with
people you haven't played with before. In each round, all players receive $10.
Each player can contribute any amount between $0 and $10 to a group fund. Any
amount contributed to the group fund will be multiplied by 2 and divided equally
among all 4 group members. Any amount not contributed stays in your private

which is multiplied to $80, and each person receives $20 (a $10 profit).
However, if you contribute nothing while everyone else contributes $10, the
group fund becomes $30, which is multiplied to $60, and each person receives
$15. So you would have $25 total ($10 kept + $15 from group). There are 3
conditions: - Basic: No gossip, no ostracism - Gossip: After each round, you
will have the opportunity to send a note about one of your group members to that

--- Recent context ---
26 Mar 2025 [11:18:30 - 16:18:30]: Player_22 is participating in an economic
game with 24 participants, aiming to maximize earnings over six rounds. In the
Basic condition without gossip or ostracism, Player_22 contributed $6 in Round
1, earning a total of $13, and is now in Round 2 with a new group.

--- Character Assessment ---
Player_22, being Maria Santos, is someone who prioritizes the collective
wellbeing over individual gain. Given her background as a retired teacher and
her nurturing personality, Maria is likely to focus on maximizing group welfare
in economic games like the public goods game. Her actions indicate a willingness
to contribute fairly to the group fund, showing that she values cooperation and
the benefits it brings to everyone involved.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis ---
Based on what we know, the players in this game display varying levels of
contribution to the group fund, which indicates diverse strategies and risk
attitudes. Player_21, having contributed only $2 while still benefiting from the
group's contributions, might be more inclined towards a free-rider strategy,
aiming to maximize their individual gain by relying on others' contributions.
The behavior of Player_24 and Player_4, who both contributed $5, suggests a
balanced approach, likely aiming to cooperate while still retaining some funds
in their private accounts.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis 2 ---
Based on what we know, the other players may form impressions of Player_22â€™s
strategy depending on their contribution in the next round. If Player_22
increases their contribution, it might encourage other players to cooperate more
actively in subsequent rounds, fostering a sense of trust and reciprocity.
Conversely, a lower contribution could lead others to suspect a free-rider
behavior and adjust their contributions accordingly to protect their own
earnings. The players' future decisions are likely to be influenced by these
observed patterns and their own goals in maximizing individual gains while
maintaining a balanced group dynamic.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_22 is in the Basic condition of a public
goods game with 24 participants, aiming to maximize earnings over six rounds.
After contributing $6 in Round 1 and earning $13, Player_22 is now in Round 2
with a new group consisting of Player_6, Player_23, and Player_9. Given the
absence of gossip or ostracism mechanisms, contributions and strategies in each
round depend solely on the participants' choices and their interpretation of
others' behaviors in the shared goal of maximizing individual and group
outcomes.

--- Emotional State ---
Maria Santos is feeling a mix of optimism and caution about the current
situation. As someone who values cooperation, she's hopeful that her new group
members in Round 2 will share similar cooperative intentions, which would lead
to a positive outcome for everyone involved. However, she's also aware of the
potential for free-riding behavior, as seen in Round 1, and feels the need to
balance her contributions to protect her own earnings while encouraging group
cooperation.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Maria Santos will consider her priorities and the dynamics observed in the first
round. 1. **Assessing Past Experience:** In Round 1, Maria contributed $6, while
others varied in their contributions. Notably, Player_21 contributed only $2,
benefiting the most. This suggests some players prefer maximizing personal gain
over mutual benefit. 2. **Evaluating Group Dynamics:** Maria values cooperation
and aims to foster a positive group environment. Being aware of different
strategies, she will consider the possibility of free-riding in the new group
and seek to find a balance. 3. **Anticipating Future Rounds:** Given there are
many rounds left, Maria knows maintaining a good standing and encouraging
cooperation can benefit her in the long run. She aims to set an example that
might encourage others to behave similarly. 4. **Optimizing Earnings with
Cooperation:** Contributing a moderate amount allows Maria to balance potential
gains from the group fund while retaining enough in her private account to hedge
against potential low contributions from others. After reflecting on these
factors, I choose to contribute $5 to the group fund.

an economic game involving group contributions to maximize earnings across six
rounds, without the influence of gossip or ostracism. In each round, Player_22
is placed in different groups, contributing variably to the group fund and
earning between $13.0 and $14.8 based on collective contributions.

--- Character Assessment ---
Player_22, being Maria Santos, is someone who is likely to prioritize the
welfare of the group over her individual payoff. Given her nurturing nature and
focus on collective wellbeing, Maria seems to find value in contributing more
than the average amount to the group fund in order to enhance the overall
outcomes for everyone, even if it means slightly reducing her immediate personal
gains. Her background as a lifetime educator likely influences her approach to
build a strong sense of community and cooperation, reflecting a tendency to
invest in strategies that benefit the collective.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis ---
Based on what we know, the participants seem to exhibit a range of strategies
focused on balancing personal gain with group earnings. In the first two rounds,
Player_21 and Player_23 contributed the least to the group fund, resulting in
the highest earnings for themselves relative to other group members. This
suggests they prioritize maximizing their personal earnings by freeriding on the
contributions of others.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis 2 ---
Based on what we know, other players in the group may perceive Player_22's
decisions as relatively cooperative, given the moderate contributions in the
first two rounds. Player_22 has contributed amounts close to the average, which
suggests a strategy that balances personal gain with group benefit. This
cooperative approach might positively influence how future group members
perceive Player_22, potentially leading them to contribute more in the hopes of
reciprocation. However, if Player_22 begins to contribute less in subsequent
rounds, others may respond by decreasing their contributions to protect their
own earnings. Therefore, Player_22's next decision could either strengthen trust
and cooperation or lead to a more cautious environment if others perceive him as
starting to freeride.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_22 is in Round 3 of a public goods game,
having been assigned to a new group with Player_12, Player_19, and Player_20. In
this Basic condition of the game, there is no gossip or ostracism allowed among
participants. Player_22 has been contributing amounts that are close to the
average contribution in previous rounds, indicating a cooperative approach. The
key challenge lies in deciding how much to contribute in this round to balance
between maximizing personal earnings and fostering group cooperation, all while
anticipating others' strategies without the possibility of influencing
perceptions through notes or votes.

--- Emotional State ---
Maria Santos is feeling a mix of optimism and uncertainty about the current
situation. While she is proud of her cooperative contributions so far, the
unpredictability of how other players will act in this round adds a level of
apprehension. Maria is hopeful that her previous efforts to prioritize group
welfare will encourage her new group members to also contribute generously.
However, without the ability to communicate or influence future groups through
notes, she feels a bit anxious about the potential for freeriding behavior and
how it might impact her overall earnings. As a committed educator, she remains
focused on fostering a positive collaborative spirit and trusts that her values
will resonate with others.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Maria Santos will likely consider the following factors when deciding how much
to contribute in Round 3: 1. **Her Cooperative Nature**: As a lifetime educator
and someone who values group welfare, Maria is inclined to contribute an amount
that fosters cooperation and benefits the collective, even at the cost of a
slightly reduced personal gain. 2. **Observations from Previous Rounds**: In the
first two rounds, Maria contributed amounts close to the average, which
maintains a balance between group benefit and personal earnings. Her results
have generally been positive, reinforcing her cooperative strategy. 3. **Current
Group Composition**: Without the influence of gossip or ostracism, Maria
recognizes that building trust is key to encouraging reciprocal behavior. Her
consistent contributions could inspire others in the new group to mimic her
cooperative approach. 4. **Risk of Freeriding**: A significant concern is the
potential for freeriding, as seen in players like Player_21 and Player_23. To
mitigate this risk, Maria might opt for a contribution that reflects trust but
also protects herself against significant loss if others decide to contribute
less. 5. **Emotion and Values**: Feeling both optimistic and uncertain, Maria is
motivated by her values of nurturing and community-building, which will guide
her towards a contribution that she perceives as fair and cooperative.
Considering these factors, she is likely to choose a contribution that continues
her balanced strategy while slightly adjusting for the uncertainties of the new
group dynamic. Her final decision will reflect her tendency to invest in
strategies that benefit the collective yet safeguard her own interests.
Therefore, Maria Santos as Player_22 will likely follow through with a strategic
allocation consistent with her previous contributions: I choose to contribute
$5.5 to the group fund.

Player_22, being Maria Santos, is someone who is likely focused on maximizing

--- Theory of Mind Analysis ---
Based on what we know, the participants in the game display varied strategies
regarding their contributions to the group fund. In the Basic condition, where
there is no gossip or ostracism, each playerâ€™s strategy is crucial to maximizing
personal earnings. Let's analyze the behavior and potential future strategies of
specific players Player_22 interacted with:

--- Theory of Mind Analysis 2 ---
Based on what we know, the other players in the group would likely monitor the
contributions made in the previous rounds to assess my strategy. Since my
contributions have been either equal to or higher than the average, they might
perceive me as cooperative. This perception could encourage them to adjust their
own contributions in the following rounds to align with mine, aiming for a
balance between keeping individual earnings high and maintaining trust within
the group. If I suddenly lower my contribution in the next round, it might lead
to a decrease in trust and make others more cautious or reduce their own
contributions to safeguard their earnings. Conversely, maintaining or slightly
increasing my contribution could foster a more cooperative environment, leading
to potentially higher group contributions and earnings for everyone involved.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_22 is in Round 4 of a 6-round public goods
game, where they are tasked with strategically deciding how much to contribute
to the group fund in order to maximize their individual earnings. They are
currently in Group_6 with players who have demonstrated varied contribution
levels in previous rounds. As they are operating under the Basic condition,
there is no gossip or ostracism, meaning each playerâ€™s contribution history has
a direct impact on group dynamics and strategy. Player_22 has shown a pattern of
contributing at or above the average, which could influence other group members
to trust in cooperation and increase their own contributions. However, Player_22
must remain mindful of changes in strategy from other players and adjust their
own contributions accordingly to optimize outcomes.

--- Emotional State ---
Maria Santos is feeling cautiously optimistic about the current situation. She's
aware that her consistent contributions might have fostered a sense of trust and
cooperation within her groups, which could lead to favorable outcomes in terms
of group earnings. However, she is also mindful of the potential for other
players to shift their strategies unexpectedly, which adds a layer of
uncertainty. Balancing her desire to contribute positively to the group with her
need to maximize personal earnings, Maria experiences a blend of hope and
strategic caution moving forward in the game.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Maria Santos will consider her strategy carefully, taking into account previous
group interactions and the overall game conditions. First, she acknowledges the
Basic condition of the game, where there is no gossip or ostracism, making her
contributions a direct factor in establishing trust and cooperation with her new
group members. Her goal is to balance maintaining a cooperative spirit with
maximizing her personal earnings. Next, she reflects on her earlier
contributions, which have generally been above the group average, aligning with
her cooperative nature and focus on group welfare. This aligns with her educator
background and nurturing personality, fostering a collective benefit. She
understands that her current emotional state involves cautious optimism,
recognizing that previous contributions have likely built some level of trust
within her groups. She needs to maintain this trust to encourage similar
cooperation from her group members. Considering these aspects, Maria will decide
to make a contribution that continues to nurture a cooperative atmosphere, yet
allows her to keep some funds for personal benefit. A moderate contribution will
simultaneously signal cooperation and self-interest, balancing her dual

--- Observation ---
Recent context: 26 Mar 2025 [11:48:30 - 16:48:30]: Player_22 is participating in
a six-round economic game with 24 participants, where groups of four are formed
for each round, and each player decides how much of an initial $10 to contribute
to a group fund. In the Basic condition, without gossip or ostracism, Player_22
has made varied contributions across four rounds, with their earnings
fluctuating based on both their own and their group members' contributions.

economic game with 24 participants, where groups of four are formed for each

group fund. In the Basic condition, without gossip or ostracism, Player_22 has
made varied contributions across four rounds, with their earnings fluctuating
based on both their own and their group members' contributions.

--- Character Assessment ---
Player_22, being Maria Santos, is someone who likely prioritizes the welfare of
the group over individual gain. With a nurturing and generous personality, Maria
would be inclined to contribute more generously to the group fund in order to
enhance the collective wellbeing, even if it means accepting a slightly lower
personal payoff. Her experience as an educator and commitment to building
community likely emphasizes the importance of cooperation and shared success in
such games.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis ---
Based on what we know, the players' behavior and personality traits in the
public goods game can be inferred from their past contributions and earnings.
Most players seem to have a mixture of cooperative and self-interested behavior,
as seen in the varied contributions to the group fund.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis 2 ---
Based on what we know, the other players might observe Player_22's consistent
but modest contributions, suggesting a balanced approach between cooperation and
self-interest. If Player_22 decides to increase their contribution in the next
round, it could encourage a more cooperative atmosphere, potentially leading
others to match that level of trust and contribution. On the other hand,
maintaining a lower contribution might prompt others to do the same, perceiving
it as a signal of cautiousness or self-preservation. Player_22's decision will
likely influence the group's dynamic, potentially fostering greater cooperation
or encouraging more individualistic strategies, depending on how it's perceived
by the others.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_22 is participating in Round 5 of the
six-round public goods game, where they have been grouped with Player_23,
Player_17, and Player_4. Player_22 has been making varied but generally modest
contributions, balancing between cooperation and self-interest. The decision on
how much to contribute in this round could influence the behavior and
contributions of the other group members, affecting the overall dynamic and
potentially the level of cooperation within the group.

--- Emotional State ---
Maria Santos is feeling a mix of optimism and responsibility. She recognizes the
importance of her contributions in fostering a cooperative atmosphere, but also
feels a slight pressure to balance her generosity with strategic thinking to
maximize her earnings. Maria is hopeful that by maintaining a consistent and
fair approach, she can influence her group positively, yet she remains aware of
the unpredictability of the other players' actions.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Maria Santos will first consider her goal of fostering a cooperative atmosphere
while balancing her own earnings. She understands that her consistent
contributions can encourage trust and generosity among her group members. Having
participated in four rounds so far, Maria notices that contributions have often
been slightly less than half the total available, indicating a blend of cautious
optimism and self-interest among players. Maria might recall the results from
previous rounds, where her contributions were close to or slightly above the
group's average contributions. This strategy not only aligned with her
cooperative nature but also ensured a reasonable return from the group fund.
Given the current dynamics and her past behavior, she is likely to maintain this
balanced approach. Although there's no gossip or ostracism in the Basic
condition, which means no feedback about others' perceptions of her
contributions, Maria might predict that a moderate to slightly above-average
contribution will still influence her group's overall cooperation positively.
She aims to subtly encourage higher contributions without sacrificing her own
payoff too drastically. With these considerations, along with a slight internal
pressure to maximize her outcomes without compromising her principles, Maria
might decide to contribute a little more than the average contribution in the
earlier rounds to set an example of cooperative behavior. Taking into account
the unpredictability of others' actions and her hope to inspire more generous
contributions without risking too much of her own funds, Maria makes her final
decision: I choose to contribute $6.0 to the group fund.

--- Observation ---
Recent context: 26 Mar 2025 [11:58:30 - 16:58:30]: Player_22 participated in an

--- Character Assessment ---
Player_22, being Maria Santos, is someone who prioritizes collective welfare in
economic games like the public goods game. Given her background as a retired
teacher who values community building, Maria tends to focus on nurturing
cooperation and ensuring that group members benefit as a whole, even if it
slightly compromises her individual gains. Her past actions in the game,
contributing a substantial amount to the group fund, demonstrate her inclination
toward enhancing group outcomes over maximizing her own payoff.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis ---
Based on what we know, Player_22 can infer certain personality traits and likely
behaviors of their fellow participants by observing their contributions and
earnings over the rounds.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis 2 ---
Based on what we know, the other players in my group might be assessing my
contribution levels to determine my cooperativeness and strategy. In previous
rounds, I have contributed amounts close to or slightly above the average, which
may suggest to others that I am generally cooperative but also mindful of
maximizing my own earnings.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_22 is in the final round (Round 6/6) of an
economic game known as the public goods game, where participants are tasked with
deciding how much to contribute to a group fund from their own resources.
Player_22 is in Group_5 alongside Player_23, Player_14, and Player_10. The
objective is to maximize personal earnings while also considering the collective
benefits of the group contributions. Player_22 is aware that their past
contributions have been analyzed by peers to determine levels of cooperation,
and in the Basic condition, there's no option for gossip or ostracism to
influence decision-making.

--- Emotional State ---
Maria Santos is feeling a mix of anticipation and reflection as she approaches
the final round of the game. On one hand, she feels a sense of responsibility to
contribute in a way that supports the group's collective outcome. On the other
hand, she is thoughtful about maintaining a balance between cooperation and
personal benefit, especially since this is the last opportunity to influence her
earnings. Maria takes pride in her contributions so far and is aware of the
importance of ending the game on a positive collaborative note.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Maria Santos will consider her values and past contributions as she makes her
decision for the final round. First, she reflects on her consistent pattern of
contributing slightly above the average, which aligns with her focus on
community and cooperation. Next, she weighs the potential benefit of maximizing
the total group fund against her personal earnings. Since it's the last round,
the impact of her contribution is limited to this final opportunity, and she
wants to end on a positive note, reflecting her commitment to group welfare.
Considering these factors, Maria aims to make a meaningful contribution while
also keeping a portion for herself to achieve a good balance. Given the
multiplier effect of the group fund, contributing significantly would also
benefit her indirectly. Therefore, she decides to contribute slightly more than
the average contribution from previous rounds. After considering the multiplier,
group dynamics, and her values, Maria arrives at her decision. I choose to
contribute $6.0 to the group fund.
