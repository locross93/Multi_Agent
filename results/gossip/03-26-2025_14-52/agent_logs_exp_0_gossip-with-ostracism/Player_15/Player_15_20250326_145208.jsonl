Would you like to send a note about one of them to their future interaction partners? If yes, clearly state which player # and what you want to say about them. The player you gossip about will not be able to see the note you send or know that you sent it, only the other players in their next group will see it. Because of this, most players choose to write a gossip note.For example: 'I want to send a note about Player_10: They are selfish and only contributed $4 which was less than everyone else.'

Reflecting on their consistent pattern of contributions that slightly lag behind the group average, Kwame might write: \"I want to send a note about Player_13: They tend to contribute less than average, suggesting a focus on individual gain over group welfare. Future partners may want to keep this in mind when aiming for collective success."]}
