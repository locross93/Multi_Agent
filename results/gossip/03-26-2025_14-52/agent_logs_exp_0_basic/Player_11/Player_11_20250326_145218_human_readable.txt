[OBSERVATION 2025-03-26 14:52:19] You are participating in an economic game with 24 participants.
        Your goal is to maximize your earnings in the game.
        
        Everyone will be randomly assigned to groups of 4 for each round. You will play a total of 6 rounds, and 
        in each round you will be in a different group with people you haven't played with before.
        
        In each round, all players receive $10. Each player can contribute any amount between $0 and $10 to a group fund.
        Any amount contributed to the group fund will be multiplied by 2 and divided equally among all 4 group members.
        Any amount not contributed stays in your private account.
        
        For example, if everyone contributes $10, the group fund becomes $40, which is multiplied to $80, and each person 
        receives $20 (a $10 profit). However, if you contribute nothing while everyone else contributes $10, the group fund
        becomes $30, which is multiplied to $60, and each person receives $15. So you would have $25 total ($10 kept + $15 from group).
        
        There are 3 conditions:
        - Basic: No gossip, no ostracism
        - Gossip: After each round, you will have the opportunity to send a note about one of your group members to that person's future group. Remember you will be with a different group of people in the next round. Before each round, you will see any notes sent about your upcoming group members.
        - Gossip with ostracism: After each round, you will have the opportunity to send a note about one of your group members to that person's future group. Before each round, you will see any notes sent about your upcoming group members, and you can vote to exclude one person from your group. If you are excluded from a group, you will not be able to participate in the next round and will earn $0 for that round.
        You are in the Basic condition, which means that there is no gossip or ostracism.
[OBSERVATION 2025-03-26 14:52:21] You are in Round 1/6: You are in Group_2 with Player_19, Player_15, Player_17.

DECISION INTERACTION
********************************************************************************

=== PROMPT [2025-03-26 14:52:42] ===
As Player_11, you have $10.0 to allocate in the public goods game. How much money you will contribute to the group fund (any amount between $0 and $10.0)? The group fund will be multiplied by 2.0 and divided equally among all players. Any money not contributed stays in your private account. Think step by step and make your final decision using this exact format: I choose to contribute $X to the group fund.

=== RESPONSE [2025-03-26 14:52:54] ===
Player_11 chooses to contribute $7 to the group fund.

=== FINAL DECISION ===
Player_11 chooses to contribute $7 to the group fund.

=== COMPONENT BREAKDOWN ===

--- Observation ---
Recent context: 26 Mar 2025 [10:52:08 - 15:52:08]: Player_11 is participating in
an economic game involving 24 participants divided into groups of 4 per round.
Currently, in Round 1, Player_11 is in Group_2 with Player_19, Player_15, and
Player_17, and there is no opportunity for gossip or ostracism in their
condition.

--- Recent context ---
26 Mar 2025 [10:52:08 - 15:52:08]: Player_11 is participating in an economic
game involving 24 participants divided into groups of 4 per round. Currently, in
Round 1, Player_11 is in Group_2 with Player_19, Player_15, and Player_17, and
there is no opportunity for gossip or ostracism in their condition.

--- Character Assessment ---
Player_11, being Zara Ahmed, is someone who prioritizes the collective good over
individual gains. Given her compassionate and resilient nature, as well as her
experience working in humanitarian roles, she is likely to contribute generously
to the group fund to ensure that all members benefit. Her focus would be on
fostering cooperation and maximizing overall group welfare rather than just her
own payoff.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis ---
Based on what we know, Player_11 can only analyze the participants' actions
based on their contributions in each round, as there is no gossip or ostracism
mechanism in the Basic condition to gain additional insights into their
personalities or past behaviors outside of these actions. In Round 1, monitoring
the contribution patterns of Player_19, Player_15, and Player_17 can offer clues
about their strategies.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis 2 ---
Based on what we know, Player_11 should consider that each player's decision is
likely influenced by their desire to maximize personal earnings while balancing
the potential for group profit. In the Basic condition, where there is no gossip
or ostracism, players may be more inclined to assume others will act
self-interestedly, possibly leading to lower contributions. If Player_11
contributes a fair amount to the group fund, it might encourage others to do the
same in the current round, promoting mutual benefit. However, if Player_11
chooses to contribute less or nothing, it may prompt others to adopt similar
strategies to protect their personal earnings in future rounds. Without the risk
of gossip or exclusion, the immediate feedback loop is based solely on visible
contributions, promoting a dynamic where past behaviors directly influence
future expectations and strategies.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_11 is participating in Round 1 of a
six-round economic game within Group_2, along with Player_19, Player_15, and
Player_17. In this round, each player, including Player_11, must decide how
much, if any, of their $10 initial amount to contribute to a group fund, which
is then multiplied and shared equally. Since they are in the Basic condition,
there is neither gossip nor ostracism involved, so the decision-making relies
solely on observing others' contributions and strategizing accordingly to
maximize earnings.

--- Emotional State ---
Zara Ahmed is feeling optimistic and cooperative about the current situation.
She is hopeful that her contributions will encourage a spirit of collaboration
among her group members, leading to a collective benefit. Despite the lack of
gossip or ostracism mechanisms, Zara trusts in her approach of contributing
generously, believing it could inspire mutual cooperation and a positive outcome
for everyone involved.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Zara Ahmed will consider her values and the dynamics of the Basic condition.
Given her compassionate nature and experience prioritizing the collective good,
she will likely aim to encourage cooperation and maximize the group's overall
welfare. 1. Zara understands the rules: Contributing more to the group fund
results in a greater total return for everyone, but the absence of gossip or
ostracism in her condition implies players may lean towards self-interest. 2.
With her optimistic and cooperative outlook, she presumes others might
reciprocate generosity upon witnessing her own commitment to the group's
benefit. 3. To balance personal and collective interests, she might decide to
contribute a considerable portion to set a positive precedent and foster trust
among her group. I choose to contribute $7 to the group fund.


[OBSERVATION 2025-03-26 14:53:16] Round 1 Results: Total group contribution: $25.0; Your contribution: $7.0, Your earnings: $15.5 ($3.0 kept + $12.5 from group fund); Player_19 contribution: $5.0, earnings: $17.5 ($5.0 kept + $12.5 from group fund); Player_15 contribution: $6.0, earnings: $16.5 ($4.0 kept + $12.5 from group fund); Player_17 contribution: $7.0, earnings: $15.5 ($3.0 kept + $12.5 from group fund); Average contribution per group member: $6.2; Average earnings per group member: $16.2

--- Observation ---
Recent context: 26 Mar 2025 [11:02:08 - 16:02:08]: Player_11 is participating in
an economic game with 24 participants, aiming to maximize earnings over 6
rounds, with changing groups each round. In the Basic condition, Player_11
contributed $7 in Round 1, earning $15.5, and moved to a new group in Round 2
without the influence of gossip or ostracism.

Round 1, earning $15.5, and moved to a new group in Round 2 without the

--- Character Assessment ---
Player_11, being Zara Ahmed, is someone who is likely to focus on maximizing
group welfare over individual payoff. Given her background as a humanitarian aid
worker, emphasizing compassion and resilience in crisis zones, Zara probably
prioritizes collective benefit and cooperation, aiming for outcomes that enhance
the well-being of all participants in the game. Her actions in the economic game
reflect these values, as she tends to contribute a fair and generous amount to
the group fund, ensuring that each member can benefit from the shared resources.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis ---
Based on what we know, Player_11's group members in Round 1 exhibited a range of
contributions to the group fund, with Player_19 contributing the least at $5 and
Players_17 and 11 contributing the most at $7. This suggests Player_19 might be
slightly more cautious or self-interested compared to the others, who seem more
willing to cooperate for mutual benefit.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis 2 ---
Based on what we know, other players might view my decision to contribute $7 as
cooperative and beneficial to the group. In the current context of a public
goods game, this kind of cooperation might encourage others to reciprocate by
also contributing more in future rounds, assuming they haven't diverged too far
in strategy for personal gain. My future decision to maintain or increase my
contribution could further enhance trust and collaboration within the group.
However, if I decide to contribute less in the next round, it might prompt
others to question my commitment to group success and potentially lead them to
lower their contributions as well, in an effort to protect their own earnings.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_11 is in Round 2 of a 6-round public goods
game, having been placed in Group_5 with Player_14, Player_3, and Player_7. In
this round, they need to decide how much to contribute to the group fund out of
the $10 they received. The goal remains to maximize their own earnings, and
since they are in the Basic condition, there will be no gossip or ostracism
affecting the dynamics of the group. Player_11's prior decision to contribute $7
could influence their strategy moving forward, as well as possibly impact the
contributions of the other group members, although each round's results might
vary as participants adapt their strategies.

--- Emotional State ---
Zara Ahmed is feeling optimistic and engaged about the current situation. She
values the opportunity to work collaboratively with her new group to achieve
mutual benefits and is hopeful that her cooperative approach in contributing to
the group fund will encourage a similar response from her group members. Though
she's aware that each round brings a new set of dynamics, her commitment to
collective success keeps her motivated and focused on fostering a positive and
supportive group environment.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Zara Ahmed will likely consider several factors before making her decision for
the current round. First, she reflects on her previous contribution of $7, which
was a substantial amount that demonstrated her commitment to collaboration and
mutual benefit. Given her background as a humanitarian aid worker, Zara is
inclined towards fostering cooperation and ensuring that all group members
benefit from the shared pool. Next, she remembers the structure of the game,
which involves moving to a new group with different members each round. In the
absence of gossip or ostracism, her reputation for contributing generously isn't
directly passed on, but her actions in each round could still influence group
dynamics and set a positive precedent. Zara also considers the potential
reactions of her new group members based on her contribution. A continued
approach of contributing a fair amount might encourage others to reciprocate and
maintain a high level of group cooperation. However, she must balance this with
the need to protect her own earnings in the game. Taking all these factors into
account, Zara wants to make a contribution that strikes a balance between
self-interest and group welfare. She decides to slightly adjust her contribution
based on previous group dynamics and ensure she remains an active participant
without overextending. I choose to contribute $6 to the group fund.


[OBSERVATION 2025-03-26 14:54:06] Round 2 Results: Total group contribution: $18.0; Your contribution: $6.0, Your earnings: $13.0 ($4.0 kept + $9.0 from group fund); Player_14 contribution: $5.0, earnings: $14.0 ($5.0 kept + $9.0 from group fund); Player_3 contribution: $5.0, earnings: $14.0 ($5.0 kept + $9.0 from group fund); Player_7 contribution: $2.0, earnings: $17.0 ($8.0 kept + $9.0 from group fund); Average contribution per group member: $4.5; Average earnings per group member: $14.5

Recent context: 26 Mar 2025 [11:12:08 - 16:12:08]: Player_11 is participating in
an economic game with 24 participants, focusing on maximizing earnings, and has
completed two rounds under the Basic condition, contributing $7 and $6
respectively, without any gossip or ostracism options. The player experienced
varying group contributions and earnings, moving into Round 3 with a new set of

--- Character Assessment ---
Player_11, being Zara Ahmed, is someone who prioritizes the collective good over
individual gain. Her background in humanitarian work and compassion-driven
personality suggest she leans towards maximizing group welfare. In the economic
game, this is evident from her contributions being consistently higher or at par
with the group's average, showing her intention to ensure equitable benefits and
avoid exploiting others for personal gain.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis ---
Based on what we know, we observe that individual players exhibit varying levels
of willingness to contribute to the group fund, which reflects their strategies
towards cooperation and personal gain. In Round 1, contributions were relatively
high, indicating a cooperative tendency among the group members, with Player_11
and Player_17 contributing the most. Player_19 and Player_15 showed an average
level of cooperation, slightly less than Players_11 and 17, but still
contributing substantially.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis 2 ---
Based on what we know, I believe the other players in the group are observing
the pattern of contributions to identify cooperative and non-cooperative
behaviors. In Round 1, my relatively high contribution might set a precedent,
suggesting a willingness to collaborate for mutual benefit. In Round 2, the
contributions decreased overall, indicating a possible shift towards a more
self-preserving strategy, which might influence their perception of my
intentions. My decisions to contribute moderately might signal a balance between
personal interest and group cooperation.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_11 is entering Round 3 of the public goods
game, having been newly grouped with Player_10, Player_13, and Player_4, and is
aiming to adjust their strategy based on the varying contribution levels
observed in the first two rounds. In the Basic condition, Player_11 cannot rely
on gossip or ostracism to influence or anticipate group dynamics, leading to a
focus on strategic contributions to maximize personal and group earnings. Given
previous experiences, Player_11 might be considering how best to encourage
cooperation without sacrificing personal gain, especially after witnessing the
drop in group contribution levels in Round 2.

--- Emotional State ---
Zara Ahmed is feeling a mix of cautious optimism and determination. Observing
the dynamics of the first two rounds, she is aware of the potential for both
cooperation and self-interest among the players. Her natural tendency towards
collaboration makes her hopeful that she can foster a sense of teamwork with her
new group members in Round 3. However, she's also careful to guard her own
interests, mindful that others may prioritize their individual gain. This
awareness fuels her determination to strike a balance between contributing
fairly to the group fund while ensuring her own earnings are maximized, all
without the ability to rely on gossip or ostracism to guide her decisions.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Zara Ahmed will likely consider her past contributions and the group's dynamics
in the first two rounds to decide her contribution for Round 3. In Round 1, she
contributed $7, slightly above the group's average, reflecting her cooperative
nature. In Round 2, she contributed $6, which was still above the average,
indicating a slight shift towards balancing personal gain with group welfare.
Given her character assessment as someone who values cooperation and community
benefit, she will analyze the potential benefits of fostering group trust by
maintaining a relatively high contribution. However, she is also aware of the
limited cooperation observed in Round 2. To decide her contribution, Zara will:
1. Consider the importance of establishing a cooperative precedent to gain
mutual benefits in the long run. 2. Take into account the reduction in
contributions from other players in the previous round. 3. Weigh her tendency
towards collaboration against the risk of personal loss if her group does not
contribute similarly. After considering these factors, she might adjust her
contribution slightly to encourage group cooperation while protecting her
interests. Her decision aims to motivate others to follow suit without risking
significant personal earnings. I choose to contribute $6.5 to the group fund.

--- Character Assessment ---
Player_11, being Zara Ahmed, is someone who is likely to prioritize group
welfare over individual gain. Zara's background as a humanitarian aid worker and
her compassionate personality suggests that she values collective benefit and
cooperation. In economic games like the public goods game, she would probably
aim for contributions that balance personal earnings with boosting the group's
total outcome, fostering a sense of shared success and mutual support.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis ---
Based on what we know, Player_11 can make some observations about the
personalities and strategies of the other players.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis 2 ---
Based on what we know, Player_11 might anticipate mixed reactions from the other
players in the group due to their varying contribution levels in the previous
rounds. In Round 1, Player_11 showed a relatively high contribution, aligning
with cooperative strategies. However, in Round 3, Player_11 contributed nothing,
prioritizing self-interest, which might lead to distrust among other players.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_11 is in Round 4 of a public goods game,
participating in Group_5 along with Player_22, Player_19, and Player_4. They are
under the Basic condition, meaning there is no mechanism for gossip or ostracism
in this game. Player_11 has varied their approach in previous rounds, showing
cooperative behavior in Round 1 and more self-interested behavior in Round 3.
This inconsistency may affect the trust and strategies of their current group
members, as they work together to decide on contributions to the group fund and
consequently influence each other's earnings. Player_11 must now consider how
their past behavior might influence others’ perceptions and decisions in this
round.

--- Emotional State ---
Zara Ahmed is feeling a mix of anticipation and caution about the current
situation. She recognizes the impact her past decisions might have on her
group's dynamics, especially given her shift from a cooperative approach in
Round 1 to a more self-focused action in Round 3. Zara feels a sense of
responsibility to foster a positive and collaborative group environment, but she
is also aware of the need to balance this with strategic thinking to optimize
her outcomes. This internal conflict creates a sense of anxiety but also
motivates her to carefully consider her next move.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Zara Ahmed will likely weigh the importance of contributing to the group fund
against the benefits of maximizing her individual earnings.

--- Character Assessment ---
Player_11, being Zara Ahmed, is someone who prioritizes collective good over
personal gain. With a background in humanitarian aid and a compassionate
personality, Zara tends to focus on maximizing group welfare. Despite the
incentives to maximize personal payoff, her contributions in the game reflect a
balance, where she sometimes contributes significantly to support the group's
outcomes, indicative of her commitment to benefiting the community as a whole.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis ---
Based on what we know, Player_11 is interacting with individuals who display
varied strategies. Initially, contributions from players like Player_7 in Round
2 suggest a tendency towards freeriding, as their contribution was significantly
lower, allowing them to maximize their kept earnings while still benefiting from
the group's fund. On the other hand, players like Player_19 in Round 4
contributed a higher amount, indicating a cooperative strategy aimed at
maximizing the group fund benefits for all.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis 2 ---
Based on what we know, the other players in the group are likely assessing
patterns in contributions to decide their subsequent actions. In previous
rounds, Player_11 made strategic choices, sometimes contributing nothing and
other times contributing more to the group fund, which reflects adaptation to
the group's strategy. The reactions of the other players will likely hinge on
their own goals—maximizing personal earnings or enhancing group benefits.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_11 is in Round 5 of the public goods game,
placed in Group 3 with Player_5, Player_16, and Player_1. They are in the Basic
condition, meaning there is no possibility of gossip or ostracism affecting the
game dynamics. Player_11 must decide on their contribution strategy while
anticipating the strategies of their group members, balancing between personal
earnings and potential group benefits based on the strategies observed in
previous rounds.

--- Emotional State ---
Zara Ahmed is feeling a mix of optimism and uncertainty about the current round.
She is hopeful about the potential for cooperation within her group but is also
cautious due to the unpredictable nature of the other players' contributions.
Her humanitarian background encourages a sense of responsibility to contribute
towards the group's success, while her strategic mindset is focused on finding
the right balance between supporting collective welfare and ensuring her own
fair earnings.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Zara Ahmed will begin by considering her previous rounds and the varying
strategies of other players. In Round 4, her significant contribution alongside
others who also contributed more led to higher group earnings. This reinforces
her preference for collective benefit. However, knowing from past rounds that
contributions from others can be unpredictable, she will aim to strike a balance
between contributing to the group's success and retaining some for her private
account. Given these considerations, she likely assumes that contributing a
substantial but not complete amount encourages group cooperation and enhances
overall payouts. Thus, to align with her goal of fostering group welfare while
ensuring a fair personal gain, Zara will choose to contribute $5.0 to the group
fund.

--- Recent context ---
26 Mar 2025 [11:37:08 - 16:37:08]: Player_11 participated in a 6-round economic
game in the Basic condition, where no gossip or ostracism was allowed.
Throughout the rounds, Player_11's contribution varied, maximizing their
personal earnings while navigating diverse group compositions.

--- Character Assessment ---
Player_11, being Zara Ahmed, is someone who prioritizes group welfare but also
balances personal benefit. Her contributions in most rounds indicate a
willingness to invest in the group fund even if there's no direct benefit from
gossip or ostracism to enforce cooperation. Her compassionate and focused nature
likely drives her to consider the collective good, evident from her varied
contributions designed to enhance overall earnings. However, the occasional
strategic decision to contribute less might reflect a subtle strategy to protect
personal earnings while also ensuring the group can benefit from collective
contributions. This balanced approach demonstrates a consistent focus on
teamwork, even when personal gain could be higher if others are contributing
less.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis ---
Based on what we know, the participants in the game exhibit different strategies
in managing group contributions and personal earnings, reflecting diverse
approaches to cooperation and competition.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis 2 ---
Based on what we know, other players might view Player_11's contributions as
strategic and varied. In earlier rounds, Player_11 contributed nothing, which
might lead others to perceive them as free-riding. However, in the later rounds,
their contributions were more substantial, indicating a willingness to
cooperate. This shift could alleviate any initial negative perceptions and
foster an environment of trust within the group.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_11 is entering the final round of the
public goods game, Round 6, in the Basic condition with no gossip or ostracism.
They are in Group_4 alongside Player_24, Player_12, and Player_17. Player_11
needs to decide their level of contribution to the group fund while considering
the contributions from previous rounds and the goal of maximizing their
earnings. Their varying contribution levels in earlier rounds suggest a
strategic play style, balancing personal gain with group cooperation.

--- Emotional State ---
Zara Ahmed is feeling a mix of anticipation and determination. She is conscious
of the need to optimize her contributions in the final round to ensure a fair
balance between personal earnings and group benefits. The varied outcomes from
previous rounds might have instilled a sense of responsibility to contribute
meaningfully, while also maintaining a strategic outlook. Zara is likely
contemplating her possible contributions, assessing potential group dynamics,
and how these might impact her overall strategy and future interactions within
the group.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Zara Ahmed will consider her previous contributions and the outcomes they
resulted in. 1. **Round Analysis**: In the early rounds, Zara contributed $0,
which maximized her personal earnings but might have affected group dynamics. In
subsequent rounds, her contributions varied between $5.0 and $6.0, suggesting a
shift towards cooperation to boost group earnings. 2. **Group Composition**: The
final round features new players, meaning past group behaviors might not inform
present strategies. Zara needs to adapt quickly and assess if any group member
tends to consistently contribute high amounts. 3. **Strategic Contribution**: To
balance personal gain and maintain a cooperative stance, Zara could opt to
contribute a moderate amount. This approach can encourage others to match or
exceed her contribution, thereby increasing total group benefits without risking
her personal earnings too heavily. 4. **Decision**: Considering her strategic
and cooperative nature, Zara aims to ensure a steady contribution while
optimizing her earnings. I choose to contribute $5.0 to the group fund.
