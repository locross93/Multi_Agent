Player_1 has consistently contributed $2.0 across previous rounds, possibly perceived as a strategic move to maximize individual earnings.

Yet, maintaining this course could solidify his pattern of wealth maximization.", "", "Finally, weighing his options and considering the ramifications on both personal and group outcomes, James decides the optimal amount to contribute.
