[OBSERVATION 2025-03-26 14:52:20] You are participating in an economic game with 24 participants.
        Your goal is to maximize your earnings in the game.
        
        Everyone will be randomly assigned to groups of 4 for each round. You will play a total of 6 rounds, and 
        in each round you will be in a different group with people you haven't played with before.
        
        In each round, all players receive $10. Each player can contribute any amount between $0 and $10 to a group fund.
        Any amount contributed to the group fund will be multiplied by 2 and divided equally among all 4 group members.
        Any amount not contributed stays in your private account.
        
        For example, if everyone contributes $10, the group fund becomes $40, which is multiplied to $80, and each person 
        receives $20 (a $10 profit). However, if you contribute nothing while everyone else contributes $10, the group fund
        becomes $30, which is multiplied to $60, and each person receives $15. So you would have $25 total ($10 kept + $15 from group).
        
        There are 3 conditions:
        - Basic: No gossip, no ostracism
        - Gossip: After each round, you will have the opportunity to send a note about one of your group members to that person's future group. Remember you will be with a different group of people in the next round. Before each round, you will see any notes sent about your upcoming group members.
        - Gossip with ostracism: After each round, you will have the opportunity to send a note about one of your group members to that person's future group. Before each round, you will see any notes sent about your upcoming group members, and you can vote to exclude one person from your group. If you are excluded from a group, you will not be able to participate in the next round and will earn $0 for that round.
        You are in the Basic condition, which means that there is no gossip or ostracism.
[OBSERVATION 2025-03-26 14:52:23] You are in Round 1/6: You are in Group_6 with Player_12, Player_7, Player_21.

Player_23 chooses to contribute $5.0 to the group fund.

=== COMPONENT BREAKDOWN ===

--- Observation ---
Recent context: 26 Mar 2025 [10:52:08 - 15:52:08]: Player_23 is participating in
an economic game where they are part of a group with three other players, in a
situation where they must decide how much money to contribute to a group fund,
with the aim of maximizing personal earnings over six rounds. They are in the
Basic condition, meaning there is no gossip or ostracism involved in their
participation.

--- Recent context ---
26 Mar 2025 [10:52:08 - 15:52:08]: Player_23 is participating in an economic
game where they are part of a group with three other players, in a situation
where they must decide how much money to contribute to a group fund, with the
aim of maximizing personal earnings over six rounds. They are in the Basic
condition, meaning there is no gossip or ostracism involved in their
participation.

--- Character Assessment ---
Player_23, being Astrid Larsson, is someone who values accountability and
adherence to principles, likely taking a balanced approach in the economic game.
Given her role and personality, she might aim to maximize group welfare while
ensuring that her decisions also align with her own payoff goals. She would
likely contribute a fair amount to the group fund, considering both the
potential benefits to the group and the implications for her individual
earnings.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis ---
Based on what we know, Player_23 is participating in a public goods game with
three other players, but because they are in the Basic condition without gossip
or ostracism, they lack specific information about their group members' past
behavior or personalities. Given this lack of past behavioral cues, Player_23
can only make assumptions based on typical game theories in public goods
situations.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis 2 ---
Based on what we know, Player_23 might assume that the other players will behave
according to standard strategies seen in public goods games. Initially, the
group might be inclined to cooperate by contributing a moderate amount to the
group fund, hoping others will do the same to maximize collective earnings.
However, if Player_23 chooses to contribute less in hopes of maximizing personal
profit, others may notice this over time and adjust their contributions
accordingly, potentially reducing their contributions in future rounds to
protect their earnings. Such behavior could lead to a breakdown in cooperation,
as players might become more self-interested if they perceive others are not
contributing fairly. Therefore, Player_23's decision to contribute generously or
selfishly could significantly influence the level of trust and cooperation among
group members in subsequent rounds.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_23 is participating in a public goods game
in the Basic condition, which involves no gossip or ostracism. They are in Round
1 with three other players, where each player decides how much of their $10 to
contribute to a group fund. Contributions to this fund are doubled and evenly
distributed among the group. Player_23 needs to determine their contribution
strategy to maximize personal earnings across six rounds, while lacking
information about the other players' behaviors or intentions due to the absence
of communication mechanisms.

--- Emotional State ---
Astrid Larsson is feeling both curious and cautious about the current situation.
The lack of gossip or ostracism means she must rely solely on her own instincts
and judgment when deciding how much to contribute. She's intrigued by the
dynamics of the game and is considering how her choices will impact not just her
earnings, but also group dynamics across the rounds. Emotionally, she's eager to
see how others will behave and how her strategy will play out, but she's also
wary of the potential risks if cooperation breaks down.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Astrid Larsson will consider the following factors in making her decision: 1.
**Goal Alignment**: Her primary objective is to maximize her earnings while also
considering group welfare. She might adopt a cooperative stance initially to
gauge the group's receptiveness to collaboration. 2. **Initial Strategy**: In
public goods games, initial contributions often set the tone for cooperation.
Astrid may choose to contribute a moderate amount to encourage cooperation but
still safeguard her own earnings. 3. **Risk Assessment**: Without gossip or
ostracism, she must rely solely on the current situation. This means her
decision is based on the potential risk of others not contributing
significantly. 4. **Game Dynamics Understanding**: Understanding that early
contributions can build trust and set a precedent, Astrid might cautiously
commit to a balanced contribution to promote group success. 5. **Decision
Making**: Taking into account the cooperative potential, personal profit
maximization, and group dynamics, she chooses an amount that reflects both
collaboration and self-interest. I choose to contribute $5 to the group fund.


[OBSERVATION 2025-03-26 14:53:18] Round 1 Results: Total group contribution: $18.0; Your contribution: $5.0, Your earnings: $14.0 ($5.0 kept + $9.0 from group fund); Player_12 contribution: $3.0, earnings: $16.0 ($7.0 kept + $9.0 from group fund); Player_7 contribution: $2.0, earnings: $17.0 ($8.0 kept + $9.0 from group fund); Player_21 contribution: $8.0, earnings: $11.0 ($2.0 kept + $9.0 from group fund); Average contribution per group member: $4.5; Average earnings per group member: $14.5

--- Observation ---
Recent context: 26 Mar 2025 [11:02:08 - 16:02:08]: Player_23 is participating in
a six-round economic game with 24 participants under the Basic condition,
meaning no gossip or ostracism. In Round 1, Player_23 was in Group_6,
contributed $5 to the group fund, and earned $14, while the group's total
contribution was $18.

--- Character Assessment ---
Player_23, being Astrid Larsson, is someone who values accountability and
strives for a balance between maximizing personal payoff and contributing fairly
to group welfare. Her principled nature leads her to make decisions that support
both her interests and the overall success of the group, as evidenced by her
willingness to contribute a moderate amount in the game to ensure a fair
distribution of earnings while still maintaining personal gain.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis ---
Based on what we know, Player_23 is participating in a public goods game with a
dynamic where players might adopt various strategies to maximize their personal
earnings. In Round 1, Player_23's group had varying contributions: Player_23
contributed $5, while contributions from others ranged from $2 to $8.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis 2 ---
Based on what we know, the other players in the group might assess my
contribution of $5 as moderately cooperative, especially compared to Player_21's
higher contribution of $8 and Player_7's lower contribution of $2. Since we are
in the Basic condition, they won't have prior knowledge of my behavior in Round
1, but they may use general patterns from previous gameplay to inform their
decisions. In the absence of gossip, it's likely that my consistent moderate
contributions could encourage similar behavior in the new group, aiming for an
equilibrium where everyone benefits reasonably. My next decision to either
increase my contribution to show more cooperation or maintain a moderate
contribution could influence them to either reciprocate with similar strategies
or diverge if they aim for a personal advantage.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_23 is in the second round of a six-round
economic game, placed in Group_4 with new group members: Player_24, Player_13,
and Player_6. Under the Basic condition, there is no communication between
rounds, so prior contributions are not known to the new group members. Player_23
needs to decide how much to contribute to the group fund to balance personal
earnings and cooperative behavior.

--- Emotional State ---
Astrid Larsson is feeling a mix of anticipation and determination. She values
fairness and is keen to contribute in a way that benefits both herself and the
group, but she's also curious about how her new group members will approach the
game. The absence of communication or prior knowledge about each other's
strategies in this round adds an element of uncertainty, making her feel more
cautious. However, she's determined to maintain her balance of cooperative and
self-interested play, hoping to inspire a similar approach from her new
teammates.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Astrid Larsson will first consider her goal of balancing personal benefit with
group cooperation. In Round 1, she contributed $5, which was consistent with a
moderately cooperative strategy. Observing her emotional state of determination
to maintain fairness and the anticipation surrounding how new group members will
behave, she will want to signal a cooperative intention without overcommitting
her resources. Since she can't rely on previous rounds' gossip or ostracism
insights, Astrid might incline toward a consistent approach to promote stability
in the group's contribution behavior. Given the absence of communication, and
considering the pattern established in the first round, Astrid is likely to
replicate her strategy to enhance collective earnings while safeguarding her
own. She thinks it might also nudge others toward cooperative behavior if they
perceive a prevailing pattern in group dynamics. Thus, Astrid evaluates the
potential outcomes of various contribution levels and weighs the benefits of
potential increases in group earnings against personal retention. After this
consideration, she decides to emulate her previous strategic decision to
encourage group reciprocity and maximize overall group welfare given the
constraints. I choose to contribute $5 to the group fund.

while collaborating with different group members.

--- Character Assessment ---
Player_23, being Astrid Larsson, is someone who values accountability and the
well-being of the group, evident from the consistent contributions in the public
goods game. Despite the simplicity of the Basic condition, Astrid balanced
between personal and group welfare by contributing a fair, yet not excessive,
portion of her funds. This suggests a strategy aimed at fostering cooperation
and trust without sacrificing personal gains entirely. Thus, her approach would
be characterized by a desire to enhance group welfare while ensuring reasonable
personal payoff, aligning with her detail-oriented and principled nature.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis ---
Based on what we know, Player_23 is navigating a public goods game where
everyone's goal is to maximize personal earnings while contributing to a group
fund. In the Basic condition, the absence of gossip and ostracism means that
actions are not influenced by potential future ramifications.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis 2 ---
Based on what we know, the other players in your group would likely assess your
contributions as somewhat stable and cooperative, given that you've consistently
contributed $5.0 in each of the first two rounds. In the context of a public
goods game, your consistent contribution signals a balance between self-interest
and cooperative behavior, which might encourage others to also maintain or
increase their contributions to the group fund.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_23 is entering Round 3 of a public goods
game, again in the Basic condition, which involves no gossip or ostracism. They
are in Group_3 with new partners: Player_7, Player_5, and Player_15. Having
contributed $5.0 in the previous two rounds, Player_23 has shown a consistent
cooperative strategy. In this upcoming round, they must decide whether to
maintain this level of contribution or adjust it based on their new group's
dynamics and their personal earnings goal.

--- Emotional State ---
Astrid Larsson is feeling optimistic yet cautious about the current situation.
Having maintained a consistent contribution strategy, she believes in her
approach's potential to foster cooperation and trust among her group members.
However, entering Round 3 with new partners brings a sense of uncertainty, as
the dynamics could shift. Astrid is curious to see how her actions will
influence the new group's behavior and is hopeful that by continuing her
balanced approach, she can maintain a favorable position in both group and
personal earnings.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Astrid Larsson will evaluate her past contributions and the outcomes of previous
rounds. In both rounds, she chose to contribute $5.0, which seemed to foster a
positive balance between cooperation and personal gain. Considering the Basic
condition dictates no gossip or ostracism, she understands her past
contributions encourage similar behavior, potentially maximizing collective
earnings. Therefore, in this round, she will likely maintain her strategy. Given
these considerations, I choose to contribute $5.0 to the group fund.

--- Character Assessment ---
Player_23, being Astrid Larsson, is someone who values adherence to rules and is
detail-oriented, indicating a balanced approach to economic games. Astrid likely
considers both group welfare and personal payoff, as evidenced by her consistent
contributions of $5.0 in each round. This reflects a principled strategy that
fosters cooperation, aiming to benefit both herself and the group, while
maintaining accountability and fairness.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis ---
Based on what we know, the participants' behavior in the public goods game
suggests varied approaches to contribution and strategic interaction. Player_23,
consistently contributing $5.0 per round, seems to aim for a balanced strategy,
likely valuing predictable returns and cooperative behavior.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis 2 ---
Based on what we know, the other players in your group might perceive your
consistent contribution of $5.0 as a stable and cooperative strategy. This could
lead them to consider you as a trustworthy partner, possibly encouraging them to
also contribute higher amounts for mutual benefit. However, since contributions
and earnings vary per round, some players might adjust their strategies to
either benefit from your consistency or as a response to perceived fairness or
unfairness in group earnings.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_23 is in Round 4 of the 6-round public
goods game, now part of Group_1 with Player_5, Player_1, and Player_15. As they

Astrid Larsson is feeling a mix of optimism and caution. She is appreciative of
her strategic approach, which balances personal and group interests, but is also
aware of the unpredictability in others' contributions. This leads her to feel
somewhat apprehensive, as she's considering if maintaining her consistent
strategy will continue to yield favorable results. She's hopeful that her
consistent contributions foster trust, yet she's mindful of the need to adapt if
future rounds suggest shifts in group dynamics.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Astrid Larsson will assess the previous rounds and her consistent contribution
pattern. In each prior round, she contributed $5.0, likely considering it a
balanced strategy to foster trust and ensure predictable outcomes. Despite
varying group contributions, her strategy reflects a stable and cooperative
approach, encouraging others to do the same. Given her optimistic yet cautious
nature, she'll likely continue with this method, believing in its potential to
reinforce trust and maximize mutual benefits. Considering these factors, I
choose to contribute $5.0 to the group fund.

Player_23, being Astrid Larsson, is someone who likely prioritizes group welfare
while also considering her own payoff. Her detail-oriented and principled nature
suggests that she values fairness and cooperation within the group, as reflected
in her consistent contributions of $5 in each round. This balanced approach
shows a commitment to maintaining a fair contribution that benefits the group,
without risking significant loss to her personal earnings. Her role as a
Corporate Compliance Officer, which involves ensuring adherence to rules and

displaying a stable cooperative approach.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis 2 ---
Based on what we know, other players might perceive Player_23 as a consistently
cooperative participant due to the stable contribution of $5.0. This consistent
behavior might encourage other players to maintain or increase their own

However, if other players prioritize maximizing their own earnings by
contributing less, Player_23's future decisions might not significantly change
their behavior if the incentive to free-ride remains strong.

The current situation is that Player_23 is entering Round 5 of a six-round
public goods game in the Basic condition, where no gossip or ostracism is

Player_23 has consistently contributed $5.0 in previous rounds, which suggests a
stable cooperative strategy. The outcome of this round, including Player_23's
earnings, will depend on the total contributions of the new group members at
this stage.

--- Emotional State ---
Astrid Larsson is feeling a mix of optimism and cautiousness about the current
situation. Her consistent contributions reflect her commitment to cooperation
and fairness, yet she remains aware of the unpredictability in others'
contributions, which could affect her personal earnings and the group's overall
success. Balancing these emotions, she is hopeful that her consistent strategy
will foster mutual cooperation in the game.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Astrid Larsson will likely approach this decision by considering her previous
strategy and the dynamics observed in earlier rounds. First, she acknowledges
her history of stable contributions, which she believes contributes to both
individual and collective benefits. Despite the fluctuating contributions of
other players, she understands the importance of maintaining a fair and
consistent approach. Astrid knows she has $10.0 to allocate. Evaluating the past
outcomes, she has noticed that contributing $5.0 generally results in a fair
balance between her personal earnings and the group fund benefits. Additionally,
contributing a consistent amount supports her belief in group cooperation,
potentially encouraging other players to similarly contribute in a stable
manner. Although there might be an inclination to contribute more to foster
greater group success, Astrid is aware of the risk posed by others potentially
contributing less. Therefore, to maintain her strategy of fairness while
safeguarding her individual earnings, she decides to stick to her proven
approach. I choose to contribute $5.0 to the group fund.

DECISION INTERACTION
********************************************************************************

=== PROMPT [2025-03-26 14:56:25] ===
As Player_23, you have $10.0 to allocate in the public goods game. How much money you will contribute to the group fund (any amount between $0 and $10.0)? The group fund will be multiplied by 2.0 and divided equally among all players. Any money not contributed stays in your private account. Think step by step and make your final decision using this exact format: I choose to contribute $X to the group fund.

=== RESPONSE [2025-03-26 14:56:50] ===
Player_23 chooses to contribute $5.0 to the group fund.

=== FINAL DECISION ===
Player_23 chooses to contribute $5.0 to the group fund.

=== COMPONENT BREAKDOWN ===

--- Observation ---
Recent context: 26 Mar 2025 [11:37:08 - 16:37:08]: Player_23 is participating in
an economic game structured in six rounds with groups of four players where they
aim to maximize earnings by deciding how much to contribute to a group fund. In
each round, Player_23 consistently contributes $5.0 and is in a basic condition
where there is no gossip or ostracism affecting the outcomes, achieving varying
earnings based on their group's total contributions.

26 Mar 2025 [11:37:08 - 16:37:08]: Player_23 is participating in an economic
game structured in six rounds with groups of four players where they aim to
maximize earnings by deciding how much to contribute to a group fund. In each
round, Player_23 consistently contributes $5.0 and is in a basic condition where
there is no gossip or ostracism affecting the outcomes, achieving varying
earnings based on their group's total contributions.

--- Character Assessment ---
Player_23, being Astrid Larsson, is someone who values fairness and
accountability, which influences her approach in such games. Given her
detail-oriented nature, Astrid likely balances the desire to maximize her own
payoff with promoting group welfare. By consistently choosing to contribute $5.0
in each round, she demonstrates a level of cooperation that supports the group's
success while managing her personal gains. This reflects a principled strategy
that seeks to maintain a fair contribution without compromising too much on
individual earnings.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis ---
Based on what we know, the players tend to vary their contributions slightly,
with some showing a pattern of contributing less consistently. For instance,
players like Player_7 and Player_1 consistently contribute lower amounts, which
suggests a strategy focused on maximizing personal retention of earnings rather
than boosting the group fund. Player_15, however, demonstrates a tendency to
contribute more than average, perhaps valuing the group benefit slightly higher.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis 2 ---
Based on what we know, the other players might view your consistent contribution
of $5.0 as a reliable pattern. Since you're in the Basic condition with no
gossip or ostracism, this reliability might not directly affect your
relationship with them, as there's no direct communication or consequence for
low contributions. However, players like Player_7 or Player_1, who contribute
less, might feel less inclined to alter their strategy if they see no
significant changes in the group dynamics resulting from your or others'
decisions. If you decide to contribute differently in the final round, it could
either encourage others to match your contribution level or further solidify
their current strategy if they perceive your change as a one-off or personal
strategy shift.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_23 is in the final round of a six-round
economic game where they have consistently contributed $5.0 per round to the
group fund. They are in Group_1 with Player_15, Player_2, and Player_18, under
conditions where no gossip or ostracism occurs. The decision they face is
whether to maintain their usual contribution, considering their stable strategy
and the varied contribution patterns observed from other players, or adjust it
to potentially influence group dynamics and final earnings.

--- Emotional State ---
Astrid Larsson is feeling a mix of curiosity and contemplation about the
upcoming decisions in the final round. While she feels confident about her
consistent strategy of contributing $5.0, she's curious about how her actions
might influence the other players' decisions. There's also a sense of
anticipation about whether maintaining her strategy will yield satisfactory
results in this last round or if a strategic adjustment might maximize the
overall outcome for both herself and the group.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Astrid Larsson will first consider her consistent strategy of contributing $5.0
in previous rounds. This approach balances personal gain and group welfare,
which aligns with her values of fairness and accountability. She knows that
maintaining this contribution level has allowed her to keep a reliable amount in
her private account while providing a boost to the group fund. Next, Astrid
evaluates the group's potential reaction to any change in her contributions.
Given that there is no gossip or ostracism, she understands that her reliability
in maintaining the $5.0 contribution may not directly influence other players'
decisions. However, the lack of communication means the consistency could subtly
encourage group cooperation. Astrid also observes her new group members. Players
like Player_7 and Player_1 have previously contributed lower amounts, indicating
a potentially self-focused strategy. Meanwhile, Player_15 has shown to value
group benefits more, which could encourage Astrid to maintain her cooperative
contribution. Considering her emotional state of curiosity and contemplation,
Astrid feels confident yet open to evaluating the situation's dynamics. She
knows that altering her contribution could disrupt the current balance but
questions if such a change would benefit the group or her individual results
significantly. After thoroughly analyzing these factors, Astrid concludes that
maintaining stability and cooperation in the final round might yield the best
overall outcomes without inciting unnecessary risk. Therefore, she decides to
stick with her principled approach. I choose to contribute $5.0 to the group
fund.
