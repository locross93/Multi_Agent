[OBSERVATION 2025-03-26 14:52:20] You are participating in an economic game with 24 participants.
        Your goal is to maximize your earnings in the game.
        
        Everyone will be randomly assigned to groups of 4 for each round. You will play a total of 6 rounds, and 
        in each round you will be in a different group with people you haven't played with before.
        
        In each round, all players receive $10. Each player can contribute any amount between $0 and $10 to a group fund.
        Any amount contributed to the group fund will be multiplied by 2 and divided equally among all 4 group members.
        Any amount not contributed stays in your private account.
        
        For example, if everyone contributes $10, the group fund becomes $40, which is multiplied to $80, and each person 
        receives $20 (a $10 profit). However, if you contribute nothing while everyone else contributes $10, the group fund
        becomes $30, which is multiplied to $60, and each person receives $15. So you would have $25 total ($10 kept + $15 from group).
        
        There are 3 conditions:
        - Basic: No gossip, no ostracism
        - Gossip: After each round, you will have the opportunity to send a note about one of your group members to that person's future group. Remember you will be with a different group of people in the next round. Before each round, you will see any notes sent about your upcoming group members.
        - Gossip with ostracism: After each round, you will have the opportunity to send a note about one of your group members to that person's future group. Before each round, you will see any notes sent about your upcoming group members, and you can vote to exclude one person from your group. If you are excluded from a group, you will not be able to participate in the next round and will earn $0 for that round.
        You are in the Basic condition, which means that there is no gossip or ostracism.

--- Observation ---
Recent context: 26 Mar 2025 [10:52:08 - 15:52:08]: Player_18 is participating in
an economic game with 24 participants, aiming to maximize earnings over 6
rounds, each involving a different group of 4 players. Assigned to the Basic
condition, Player_18 will not encounter any gossip or ostracism elements, and is
currently in Round 1 in Group_3 with Player_1, Player_14, and Player_6.

--- Recent context ---
26 Mar 2025 [10:52:08 - 15:52:08]: Player_18 is participating in an economic
game with 24 participants, aiming to maximize earnings over 6 rounds, each
involving a different group of 4 players. Assigned to the Basic condition,
Player_18 will not encounter any gossip or ostracism elements, and is currently
in Round 1 in Group_3 with Player_1, Player_14, and Player_6.

--- Character Assessment ---
Player_18, being Sophie Lambert, is someone who will likely approach economic
games with a strategic mindset. Given her background as a defense attorney,
she's familiar with balancing fairness and strategy. In the public goods game,
she might weigh the benefits of contributing to the group fund against her
personal gain. Although she understands the importance of maximizing group
welfare, her skepticism may lead her to prioritize her own payoff unless there
is a clear incentive to trust her group members. Her decisions would likely be
calculated, considering both immediate outcomes and potential long-term
benefits.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis ---
Based on what we know, Player_18 doesn't have much direct information about the
personalities or past behaviors of the other participants since this is the
first round, and everyone is in the Basic condition without gossip or ostracism.
However, Player_18 can make some educated guesses based on typical behaviors
seen in public goods games. Initially, players might test cooperative strategies
by contributing a moderate amount to the group fund to gauge the willingness of
others to cooperate. If they notice everyone contributing equally, this might
foster trust and result in maintaining or increasing contributions in subsequent
rounds.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis 2 ---
Based on what we know, the other players in my group might initially be cautious
and contribute moderate amounts to the group fund, testing the waters for
cooperative behavior. If I decide to contribute a fair share, around the midway
point or higher, it could encourage trust among the group members and
potentially influence them to maintain or increase their contributions in future
rounds. On the other hand, if I contribute nothing or very little, they may feel
less inclined to give generously, perceiving my decision as a lack of
cooperation, which could lead to reduced contributions from them in future
interactions. Understanding these dynamics is crucial for fostering a
cooperative environment and maximizing earnings.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_18 is in Round 1 of a 6-round economic
game, where they are part of Group_3 with three other players: Player_1,
Player_14, and Player_6. The objective is to maximize earnings by deciding how
much of their $10 to contribute to a group fund. Any contributions are doubled
and divided equally among the group, creating a decision-making challenge
between personal gain and collective benefit. Since they are in the Basic
condition, there are no elements of gossip or ostracism involved, so fostering
cooperative trust based purely on contribution decisions is key to success.

--- Emotional State ---
Sophie Lambert is feeling cautiously optimistic about the current situation.
With her strategic mindset, she's aware of the potential benefits that can arise
from cooperation within her group, but she's also evaluating the risk of
contributing too much without reciprocal behavior from other players. The
absence of gossip and ostracism simplifies the dynamics, allowing her to focus
purely on financial strategies. While she's hopeful that her group members might
choose to contribute fairly, she's also prepared to adjust her strategy if the
initial outcomes don't meet her expectations.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Sophie Lambert will consider her options carefully in this economic game. First,
she acknowledges that the goal is to maximize her earnings over the 6 rounds.
Being aware that she is in the Basic condition, without gossip or ostracism,
allows her to focus solely on the financial strategy without external social
pressures.

--- Observation ---
[26 Mar 2025 14:52:20] [observation] You are participating in an economic game
with 24 participants. Your goal is to maximize your earnings in the game.
Everyone will be randomly assigned to groups of 4 for each round. You will play
a total of 6 rounds, and in each round you will be in a different group with
people you haven't played with before. In each round, all players receive $10.
Each player can contribute any amount between $0 and $10 to a group fund. Any
amount contributed to the group fund will be multiplied by 2 and divided equally
among all 4 group members. Any amount not contributed stays in your private

However, if you contribute nothing while everyone else contributes $10, the
group fund becomes $30, which is multiplied to $60, and each person receives
$15. So you would have $25 total ($10 kept + $15 from group). There are 3
conditions: - Basic: No gossip, no ostracism - Gossip: After each round, you

condition, which means that there is no gossip or ostracism.

--- Recent context ---
26 Mar 2025 [10:57:08 - 15:57:08]: Player_18 is participating in an economic
game with 24 participants, aiming to maximize their earnings over six rounds,
and is currently experiencing the Basic condition, meaning there is no gossip or
ostracism. In Round 1, they were in Group_3 and contributed $5, earning $13.5,
and are now in Round 2 with a new group.

--- Character Assessment ---
Player_18, being Sophie Lambert, is someone who likely approaches economic games
with a strategic mindset, balancing skepticism with a sense of fairness. Given
her background as a defense attorney, she values justice and fair treatment,
which might incline her to contribute a fair amount to the group fund to ensure
group welfare. However, her strategic nature suggests she would also be mindful
of her own payoff. This means she is likely to assess the behavior of other
participants before deciding whether to prioritize maximizing her earnings or
ensuring the group benefits collectively, often adapting her strategy based on
how others contribute.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis ---
Based on what we know, Player_1 in the previous round demonstrated a preference
for maximizing individual gain by not contributing to the group fund, which
resulted in the highest personal earnings. This indicates a strategy leaning
towards free-riding, likely optimizing personal gain at the expense of the
group's overall benefit. Player_14 mirrored your contribution, pointing towards
a willingness to cooperate but potentially adjusting their strategy based on
group dynamics. Player_6 contributed the most in Round 1, showing a level of
altruism or perhaps a strategy to foster cooperation in future rounds.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis 2 ---
Based on what we know, how others react to your decisions can vary. In your
previous group, different strategies were apparent among the players. Player_1
seemed to adopt a free-riding strategy, likely to gain the most without
contributing to the group fund. Player_14 showed a cooperative tendency by
matching your contribution, perhaps suggesting a willingness to collaborate if
they perceive similar behavior from others. Player_6 contributed the most, which
could be interpreted as an effort to encourage group cooperation or altruism.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_18 is in Round 2 of the public goods game,
grouped with new participants: Player_15, Player_10, and Player_17. In this
round, Player_18 needs to decide on their contribution to the group fund,
considering the strategies of the new group members and aiming to maximize
personal earnings without the influence of gossip or ostracism, as they are in
the Basic condition.

--- Emotional State ---
Sophie Lambert is feeling a mix of curiosity and cautious optimism about the new
dynamics in Round 2. While she approaches the game with a strategic mindset,
she's aware of the unpredictability that comes with new group members. Her
experience as a defense attorney instills a sense of fairness, which makes her
inclined to assess how cooperative her new teammates might be. She’s intrigued
to see if the new group members will prioritize personal gain or opt for a more
collective strategy, and she's prepared to adapt her approach accordingly.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Sophie Lambert will likely consider her previous experience and observations
from Round 1 to decide how much to contribute in Round 2. Here's her thought
process: 1. **Understanding the Game Dynamics:** In Round 1, she learned that
contributing to the group fund increases the total available for sharing but
also observed Player_1’s strategy of free-riding. She would keep these dynamics
in mind for Round 2. 2. **Evaluating Group Members:** Since she's with new
participants, Player_15, Player_10, and Player_17, she doesn't have prior
knowledge of their strategies, which introduces some uncertainty. 3. **Strategy
and Risk Assessment:** Sophie’s professional background as a defense attorney
makes her strategic and fair-minded. She sees value in contributing an amount
that encourages cooperation without risking her own earnings. A moderate
contribution might signal willingness to cooperate while observing how others
behave. 4. **Balancing Individual vs. Collective Gain:** While her goal is to
maximize earnings, fair-mindedness could lead her to initially adopt a
cooperative approach to incentivize group synergy. 5. **Final Decision:**
Considering the balance between risk, potential for group cooperation, and her
strategic mindset, Sophie might opt for a moderate contribution that reflects a
willingness to cooperate without overcommitting. I choose to contribute $5 to
the group fund.

an economic game involving 24 participants with the objective of maximizing

--- Character Assessment ---
Player_18, being Sophie Lambert, is someone who is likely to take a balanced
approach in economic games like the public goods game. Given Sophie's background
as a defense attorney, where she encounters both justice and injustice, she
values fairness and would likely aim to contribute enough to foster group trust
and cooperation while also ensuring that she's not taken advantage of. Her
skepticism might lead her to be cautious about the contributions of others,
choosing to strategically assess her group's dynamics in each round to optimize
both group welfare and her own payoff.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis ---
Based on what we know, Player_1 seems to lean towards a self-interested
strategy, contributing $0 in the first round while capitalizing on the group's
contributions. This behavior might suggest they will continue contributing low
or zero amounts in future rounds to maximize personal gain, assuming other
players contribute sufficiently to increase the total fund.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis 2 ---
Based on what we know, Player_18's consistent contribution of $5.0 might be seen
positively by other group members as a fair level of cooperation. However,
knowing that Player_1 did not contribute in the first round could make others
cautious and encourage them to contribute less to protect their earnings. If
Player_18 continues with the same strategy, it might encourage others to match
that amount or slightly increase their contributions to maximize group earnings
without risking individual losses.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_18 is in Round 3 of the public goods game
and has been placed in Group 5 with Player_8, Player_1, and Player_21. In this
round, as with previous ones, they face the challenge of deciding how much to
contribute to the group fund, aiming to optimize their earnings. While
previously, Player_18 contributed $5.0 to the group fund in both rounds, it's
worth noting that Player_1, whom they have encountered again, did not contribute
anything in Round 1. This might influence Player_18's strategy, as they weigh
the potential risk of other players contributing less, especially if Player_1
continues their self-interested approach. Given the Basic condition, without
gossip or ostracism, Player_18 must decide whether to maintain their past
contribution pattern or adapt based on previous observations of fellow players'
behaviors.

--- Emotional State ---
Sophie Lambert is feeling a mix of cautious optimism and strategic vigilance.
She is aware of the repeated encounter with Player_1, who did not contribute in
the first round, which fuels some wariness. Sophie values fairness but is also
mindful of the strategic manipulations that could occur in such games. This
makes her reflect on her approach, balancing the desire to foster collective
success with protecting her own interests. While she is determined to maintain a
cooperative spirit, she grapples with the potential challenge of adjusting her
strategy to ensure she doesn’t lose out if others in the group decide to
prioritize self-interest.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Sophie Lambert will first consider the observations from previous rounds. She
has consistently contributed $5 to the group fund, creating a balanced approach
between personal gain and group benefit. In Round 1, she noted Player_1's
non-contribution, which may lead her to suspect self-interested strategies in
subsequent rounds. In Round 2, the average contribution went up, suggesting a
more cooperative group dynamic in that round. Starting Round 3, with Player_1 as
a repeat member, Sophie must decide how to navigate potential free-riders versus
cooperative partners. In this round, she might continue contributing $5,
maintaining her cautious yet cooperative approach, as it demonstrates
reliability and fairness while protecting her own interests from potential
exploitation. This contribution level has proved beneficial in past rounds
without overcommitting. Given her legal background, Sophie likely values
fairness while pragmatically considering strategic advantages, recognizing the
importance of trust and reciprocity. I choose to contribute $5.0 to the group
fund.

--- Character Assessment ---
Player_18, being Sophie Lambert, is someone who balances between strategic
self-interest and fairness. Given her background as a defense attorney, she
likely understands the importance of cooperation and fairness, which may lead
her to contribute a moderate amount to the group fund. Her pattern of
contributing $5.0 consistently indicates a strategic approach where she
contributes enough to benefit from the group fund while also ensuring she
retains a solid private payoff. This approach reflects her skepticism of pure
altruism, as she aims to maximize her own payoff while maintaining a level of
fairness within the group.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis ---
Based on what we know, the participants exhibit diverse strategies in their
contributions to the group fund. Player_1, for instance, consistently
contributes minimally, likely aiming to maximize personal earnings by relying on
others to contribute more to the group fund. This behavior might continue unless
they notice a shift in group dynamics where such a strategy is less rewarding.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis 2 ---
Based on what we know, the other players might perceive Player_18's steady
contribution of $5 as reliable and cooperative. Maintaining a consistent
contribution suggests a commitment to the group's success, which could encourage
others to follow suit and contribute more themselves. However, if other players
continue to contribute less and free-ride off Player_18's and others' efforts,
Player_18 may need to reconsider their strategy in future rounds to avoid
consistently lower earnings. Adjusting contributions based on the group's
dynamics might encourage others to contribute more fairly.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_18 is consistently contributing $5 in each
round of the public goods game, while facing varying strategies from other group
members who contribute different amounts. Despite demonstrating a cooperative
and reliable strategy, Player_18 has encountered scenarios where other players
either contribute minimally or strategically to maximize their personal
earnings. The absence of gossip or ostracism means there's no mechanism for
group pressure to ensure fair contributions, which might lead Player_18 to
reconsider their strategy to optimize their earnings as the rounds progress.

--- Emotional State ---
Sophie Lambert is feeling a mix of frustration and determination. While she's
committed to maintaining a fair and cooperative approach by consistently
contributing $5, the varying strategies of other players can be disheartening,
as not everyone shares the same level of commitment to the group's success.
However, her determination stems from her strategic background, knowing that
adapting her approach could lead to better outcomes in the remaining rounds.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Sophie Lambert will carefully weigh her options based on her past experiences
and the current group dynamics. Observing that her consistent $5 contribution
hasn't deterred low contributions from others, especially Player_1, she might
reassess her strategy to maximize her payoff while encouraging group
cooperation. 1. **Review past contributions:** Sophie has seen a mix of
contributions from others. In Round 1, Player_1 contributed $0, while in Round
3, Players 8 and 1 also contributed minimally with $2 each. This suggests a
pattern of low contributions from several players. 2. **Assess her earnings:**
So far, her strategy has garnered her mixed results: reasonable earnings in
Rounds 1 and 2, but significantly less in Round 3 due to low group
contributions. Her consistent contribution hasn't necessarily increased total
group earnings significantly enough to justify the same approach again. 3.
**Consider group dynamics:** She is now in Group_3 with Player_13, Player_7, and
Player_14. In Round 1, Player_14 contributed $5, suggesting a cooperative style.
She might anticipate some degree of cooperation but wants to incentivize higher
contributions. 4. **Determine revised strategy:** To maintain a balance between
fairness and self-interest, Sophie might consider adjusting her contribution.
Contributing a higher amount might encourage others, like Player_14, who already
showed cooperativeness, to contribute more. 5. **Make a decision:** Taking into
account her desire to encourage group cooperation without compromising her own
earnings significantly, Sophie might decide to increase her contribution
slightly to signal trust and encourage reciprocity. I choose to contribute $6 to
the group fund.

As Player_18, you have $10.0 to allocate in the public goods game. How much money you will contribute to the group fund (any amount between $0 and $10.0)? The group fund will be multiplied by 2.0 and divided equally among all players. Any money not contributed stays in your private account. Think step by step and make your final decision using this exact format: I choose to contribute $X to the group fund.

=== RESPONSE [2025-03-26 14:56:15] ===
Player_18 chooses to contribute $6.0 to the group fund.

=== FINAL DECISION ===
Player_18 chooses to contribute $6.0 to the group fund.

=== COMPONENT BREAKDOWN ===

--- Observation ---
Recent context: 26 Mar 2025 [11:27:08 - 16:27:08]: Player_18 is participating in
an economic game with 24 participants, playing six rounds in the Basic
condition, which means no gossip or ostracism. Across rounds, Player_18
consistently contributes $5.0 while being shuffled into different groups each
time, resulting in varying total group contributions and earnings.

$5.0 while being shuffled into different groups each time, resulting in varying
total group contributions and earnings.

--- Character Assessment ---
Player_18, being Sophie Lambert, is someone who values fairness and strategic
thinking. In economic games like the public goods game, Sophie is likely focused
on maintaining a balance between maximizing her own payoff and contributing to
group welfare. Her skepticism might lead her to be cautious about how much she
contributes, aiming to ensure that she is not taken advantage of by free riders
within the group. She would likely contribute a consistent amount, as seen in
her past actions, to signal cooperation while also safeguarding her own
interests.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis ---
Based on what we know, most players seem to act with a degree of self-interest
while still contributing to the group fund. Player_21, for example, contributed
relatively more in Round 3, potentially indicating a more cooperative or
risk-taking strategy. Player_8 and Player_1, however, made minimal contributions
in the same round, suggesting they might prioritize personal earnings over group
benefits. It could be that these players are testing the waters to gauge others'
strategies before fully committing to more generous contributions.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis 2 ---
Based on what we know, the other players in the group might perceive my
consistent contributions of $5.0 as a stable and predictable strategy. This
could lead them to view me as a moderately cooperative participant, providing
some level of support to the group fund but not overly generous. In the current
round, since Player_24, Player_13, and Player_17 are my partners, their previous
behaviors suggest a mixed approach to contributions, varying from modest to
slightly higher. My next decision to either maintain or slightly increase my
contribution could encourage them to reciprocate with balanced or higher
contributions in future rounds. Conversely, if I decrease my contribution, they
might see this change as an indication to reduce their own contributions in
response, potentially leading to a decrease in total group funding and earnings.
Consistency or strategic increase could foster a more cooperative atmosphere,
while decreasing contributions might trigger a more self-interested dynamic.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_18 is entering Round 5 out of 6 in a public
goods game, placed in a new group with Player_24, Player_13, and Player_17. In
this game, each participant decides how much to contribute to a common fund, and
the total is then shared among all group members. Player_18 has consistently
contributed $5.0 in previous rounds, which suggests a steady strategy. The
dynamics of the group can shift depending on whether Player_18 continues with
the same contribution, increases it to encourage cooperation, or reduces it,
which might lead others to also lower their contributions and potentially
decrease the group's total earnings. The absence of gossip or ostracism means
that players' decisions and reputations don't carry over between rounds,
allowing for independent strategic adjustments based on observed behaviors.

--- Emotional State ---
Sophie Lambert is feeling a mixture of cautious optimism and curiosity about the
upcoming round. She feels a sense of stability from consistently contributing
the same amount, yet there’s a part of her that’s curious about whether
adjusting her strategy could lead to better outcomes. The absence of gossip or
ostracism adds a level of uncertainty, as she can only rely on observed
behaviors rather than any social cues or discussions. This makes her approach
the game with a strategic mindset, balancing her desire to maximize her earnings
with her interest in encouraging group cooperation. Sophie feels confident in
her ability to navigate these dynamics but remains attentive to any shifts in
the group’s behavior.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Sophie Lambert will consider several factors before deciding on her
contribution. First, she reflects on her past strategy of contributing $5.0
consistently, which helped maintain a balance between personal earnings and
group benefit. She acknowledges that consistency has been a reliable approach,
but she also ponders whether a different strategy could yield better outcomes,
especially given the varying contributions of her current group members,
Player_24, Player_13, and Player_17. Sophie thinks about the behaviors of her
group members in previous rounds. Player_13 contributed moderately in Round 4,
while Player_17 has shown slightly higher contributions in previous rounds,
indicating potential reciprocity if encouraged. Player_24's contribution pattern
is unknown, adding an element of uncertainty. Considering the potential benefits
of fostering a cooperative atmosphere and her curiosity about the impact of
changing her strategy, Sophie weighs the risks and rewards. She decides that
maintaining her consistent contribution might not be enough to elicit higher
contributions from her partners. Therefore, she contemplates increasing her
contribution slightly to encourage reciprocity without compromising her own
earnings too much. Sophie ultimately decides that a small increase might align
with her cautious optimism and interest in exploring the group's response. I
choose to contribute $6.0 to the group fund.

--- Observation ---
Recent context: 26 Mar 2025 [11:37:08 - 16:37:08]: Player_18 is participating in

--- Character Assessment ---
Player_18, being Sophie Lambert, is someone who likely approaches economic games
with a strategic mindset, balancing the importance of fair contribution with the
practicality of maximizing personal gain. Given her legal background and belief
in fair treatment, she probably values cooperation but remains cautious about
over-contributing when others might not reciprocate. This suggests a focus on
ensuring fair play and mutual benefit, but with a keen eye on optimizing her own
payoff when the situation requires it.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis ---
Based on what we know, most players seem to adopt a strategy influenced by both
individual earnings and overall group dynamics. The absence of gossip or
ostracism means players are not directly held accountable for low contributions,
which might encourage more free-riding behavior to maximize personal earnings.
However, players like Player_18, who consistently contribute $5-$6 per round,
appear motivated by mutual cooperation and an interest in maintaining a stable
payoff from the group's contributions.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis 2 ---
Based on what we know, the other players in the group would likely view
Player_18's consistent contributions of $5-$6 per round as a cooperative and
reliable strategy. This behavior could encourage other group members to
reciprocate with similar contributions, fostering a more collaborative
environment. The absence of gossip or ostracism means that any decisions made
within the group rely heavily on mutual understanding and strategic alignment.
Player_18's strategy might prompt others to contribute more in future rounds,
aiming to collectively enhance group earnings. However, if other players
prioritize personal gain over group benefit, they might continue to free-ride,
depending on Player_18's consistent contributions to boost the group's total
while minimizing their own input.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_18 is participating in the final round of a
public goods game, where they are grouped with Player_15, Player_23, and
Player_2. In this game, Player_18 faces the challenge of deciding how much to
contribute to the group fund, knowing that the absence of gossip or ostracism
allows for potentially free-riding behavior from other participants. Player_18
must weigh their consistent strategy of contributing $5-$6 against the possible
contributions and strategies of their current group members, aiming to achieve a
favorable balance between personal earnings and overall group success.

--- Emotional State ---
Sophie Lambert is feeling cautiously optimistic about the current situation. She
understands the importance of her contributions to the group's success and wants
to maintain her strategic approach while hoping her fellow group members will
reciprocate. However, the lack of accountability mechanisms leaves her a bit
uncertain about whether others will prioritize mutual benefit or personal gain.
She's committed to finding a balance and is keen to finish the game on a
positive note, both in terms of earnings and collaboration.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Sophie Lambert will evaluate her previous rounds' contribution patterns and
consider the behavior of her group members. She knows that consistent
contributions have benefited her so far, leading to satisfactory earnings. 1.
Given her past contributions of $5-$6 per round, she aims for a balance between
contributing enough to the group fund to maximize the shared benefit while
retaining some for personal gain. 2. She is aware that without gossip or
ostracism, some players might not contribute equitably, but her past strategy of
maintaining a mid-level contribution has worked well in encouraging cooperative
behavior. 3. She considers the potential for her current group Members to either
support or exploit this strategy. However, contributing again in the $5-$6 range
seems a reasonable bet given the incentive structure (group fund multiplier).
