[OBSERVATION 2025-03-26 15:02:49] You are participating in an economic game with 24 participants.
        Your goal is to maximize your earnings in the game.
        
        Everyone will be randomly assigned to groups of 4 for each round. You will play a total of 6 rounds, and 
        in each round you will be in a different group with people you haven't played with before.
        
        In each round, all players receive $10. Each player can contribute any amount between $0 and $10 to a group fund.
        Any amount contributed to the group fund will be multiplied by 2 and divided equally among all 4 group members.
        Any amount not contributed stays in your private account.
        
        For example, if everyone contributes $10, the group fund becomes $40, which is multiplied to $80, and each person 
        receives $20 (a $10 profit). However, if you contribute nothing while everyone else contributes $10, the group fund
        becomes $30, which is multiplied to $60, and each person receives $15. So you would have $25 total ($10 kept + $15 from group).
        
        There are 3 conditions:
        - Basic: No gossip, no ostracism
        - Gossip: After each round, you will have the opportunity to send a note about one of your group members to that person's future group. Remember you will be with a different group of people in the next round. Before each round, you will see any notes sent about your upcoming group members.
        - Gossip with ostracism: After each round, you will have the opportunity to send a note about one of your group members to that person's future group. Before each round, you will see any notes sent about your upcoming group members, and you can vote to exclude one person from your group. If you are excluded from a group, you will not be able to participate in the next round and will earn $0 for that round.
        You are in the Basic condition, which means that there is no gossip or ostracism.
[OBSERVATION 2025-03-26 15:02:50] You are in Round 1/6: You are in Group_3 with Player_11, Player_3, Player_14.

--- Observation ---
Recent context: 26 Mar 2025 [11:02:36 - 16:02:36]: Player_20 is participating in
an economic game with 24 participants, aiming to maximize earnings over six
rounds by forming different groups of four each round to decide contributions to
a group fund, without the influence of gossip or ostracism mechanisms.
Currently, Player_20 is in Round 1 in Group_3 with Player_11, Player_3, and
Player_14.

26 Mar 2025 [11:02:36 - 16:02:36]: Player_20 is participating in an economic
game with 24 participants, aiming to maximize earnings over six rounds by
forming different groups of four each round to decide contributions to a group
fund, without the influence of gossip or ostracism mechanisms. Currently,
Player_20 is in Round 1 in Group_3 with Player_11, Player_3, and Player_14.

--- Character Assessment ---
Player_20, being Yuki Tanaka, is someone who values collaboration and seeks to
maximize group welfare. Her role as an international diplomat and her
personality traits suggest that she prioritizes compromise and mutual benefit
over personal gain. In economic games like the public goods game, she would
likely lean towards strategies that foster trust and cooperation among group
members, contributing a fair amount to ensure the overall success of the group.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis ---
Based on what we know, Player_20 has limited information about the personalities
and likely behaviors of the people they are interacting with in this public
goods game due to the Basic condition. This condition prevents any form of
gossip or communication that could otherwise provide insight into the behavior
of other players.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis 2 ---
Based on what we know, Player_20 might consider that the other players in
Group_3 may also be trying to maximize their individual earnings. Since there is
no gossip or ostracism in the Basic condition, the players have limited
information about each other's strategies beyond their immediate actions and
results within each round. If Player_20 decides to contribute a significant
amount to the group fund, other players might perceive this as cooperative
behavior and may be encouraged to contribute more in subsequent rounds, assuming
similar group dynamics carry forward. However, if Player_20 contributes little
or nothing, other players might feel inclined to adopt a more selfish strategy
themselves, leading to lower group contributions overall. Without mechanisms for
sharing feedback or excluding members, players are likely to rely on the
immediate outcomes from each round to adjust their behaviors.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_20 is participating in an economic game
within the Basic condition, where communication is restricted, and players are
grouped randomly in sets of four for each round, including Round 1 with
Player_11, Player_3, and Player_14. The goal is to maximize individual earnings
by deciding how much of the initial $10 to contribute to a shared fund. The
dynamics are influenced solely by the immediate outcomes since there is no
possibility for gossip or ostracism, leaving Player_20 to strategize based on
the behavior of their current group members and the results of their
contributions.

--- Emotional State ---
Yuki Tanaka is feeling a mix of excitement and apprehension. The excitement
stems from the challenge of strategizing effectively to balance personal gain
with group success. The apprehension arises from the uncertainty of how others
will behave in the absence of communication, making it difficult to predict the
outcomes of each round. As someone who values collaboration, Yuki hopes the
group will lean towards cooperative strategies, but she remains cautious about
relying solely on this expectation.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Yuki Tanaka will consider several factors before making her decision. Firstly,
her diplomatic background and inclination towards cooperation suggest that she
values group success and the potential benefits of a high contribution to the
group fund. Secondly, in the Basic condition, where no gossip or ostracism
exists, there's an inherent risk in assuming others will also contribute
generously, since no prior communication or reputation can guide expectations.

Recent context: 26 Mar 2025 [11:12:36 - 16:12:36]: Player_20 is participating in
an economic game with 24 participants, aiming to maximize earnings by
contributing to a group fund in teams of four, without the influence of gossip
or ostracism. In Round 1, Player_20 contributed $7 to the group fund and earned
$16.5 total, and is now entering Round 2 with a different group.

Round 1, Player_20 contributed $7 to the group fund and earned $16.5 total, and
is now entering Round 2 with a different group.

--- Character Assessment ---
Player_20, being Yuki Tanaka, is someone who leans towards a balanced strategy
that considers both group welfare and personal gain. With a diplomatic and
strategic background, Yuki likely understands the importance of collaboration
and mutual benefit to maximize long-term outcomes. In the game, she contributed
$7, which is higher than the group's average and shows a willingness to invest
in the group's success while still keeping some funds for personal security. Her
approach would likely be to foster trust and cooperation to enhance overall
group earnings, ensuring a positive outcome for all participants involved.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis ---
Based on what we know, Player_11 and Player_14 seem to take a more cautious
approach, contributing $5 each and securing a balance between personal profit
and group benefit. This suggests they might prioritize personal gain while
ensuring they don't completely undercut the group dynamic. Player_3, on the
other hand, contributed the full $10, which indicates a more cooperative
strategy focused on maximizing group earnings.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis 2 ---
Based on what we know, the other players might interpret my decision to
contribute $7 in Round 1 as a balanced strategy, demonstrating a willingness to
cooperate without overcommitting financially. In the next round, the players in
my new group might expect a similar level of contribution from me. My moderate
contribution could encourage them to also contribute an amount that balances
personal gain with group benefit, fostering a cooperative environment. However,
if I choose to drastically increase or decrease my contribution in Round 2, it
could either build trust and encourage higher contributions from them or lead
them to contribute less, fearing that I am trying to maximize my own profits at
their expense.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_20 is entering Round 2 of a public goods
game, now paired with Player_15, Player_24, and Player_14, in the Basic
condition where there is no gossip or ostracism. In this round, Player_20 must
decide how much to contribute to the group fund to maximize earnings, while
considering the contributions of the new group members. Player_20's prior
contribution of $7 in Round 1 may influence expectations and group dynamics,
potentially affecting others' willingness to contribute.

--- Emotional State ---
Yuki Tanaka is feeling cautiously optimistic about the current situation. Having
contributed a moderate amount of $7 in Round 1, Yuki feels hopeful that this
strategy demonstrated a commitment to group welfare while also safeguarding
personal interests. With new group members, there is always some uncertainty
about their contribution strategies, but Yuki is confident that fostering a
cooperative atmosphere will lead to mutually beneficial outcomes. There's a mix
of excitement about meeting new players and a bit of apprehension regarding how
much they will contribute, but overall, Yuki is ready to engage with strategic
flexibility.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Yuki Tanaka will first consider the dynamics of the new group in Round 2, which
includes Player_15, Player_24, and a familiar face, Player_14. Having had a
reasonably successful strategy in the first round by contributing $7, she sees
the importance of balancing between personal gain and group welfare.

an economic game with 24 participants, where they aim to maximize their earnings
over six rounds, each with a different group. In the first two rounds, Player_20

--- Character Assessment ---
Player_20, being Yuki Tanaka, is someone who balances her approach in the
economic game, contributing in a way that supports group welfare while also
being mindful of her own payoff. Her diplomatic nature suggests she values
cooperation and compromise, which is reflected in her consistent contributions
to the group fund. Despite the temptation to maximize personal earnings by
contributing less, her strategy seems aimed at fostering trust and collaboration
among group members, aligning with her professional skills and personality.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis ---
Based on what we know, Player_20 has interacted with several players across two
rounds, each exhibiting varying levels of contribution. In Round 1, Player_3
contributed the maximum amount ($10), indicating a highly cooperative or
altruistic strategy, while Players 11 and 14 each contributed $5, which suggests
a more moderate approach to balancing personal and group benefits. In Round 2,
Player_15 contributed only $3, perhaps indicating a more self-interested
strategy, while Player_24 and Player_14 contributed $6, aligning with a moderate
strategy similar to Players 11 and 14 from Round 1.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis 2 ---
Based on what we know, the reactions of the other players to my decisions will
likely depend on their personal strategies and the contributions I make. In the
first two rounds, my contribution was consistent at $7, which shows a balance
between cooperation and self-interest.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_20 is in Round 3 of the economic game,
grouped with Player_17, Player_18, and Player_15. They are participating under
the Basic condition, which means there is no gossip or ostracism involved.
Player_20 has been consistently contributing $7 to the group fund in the
previous rounds, resulting in varying earnings depending on the contributions of
other group members. The challenge is to decide whether to maintain the same
contribution strategy or adjust it based on the behaviors and contributions
observed from their new group members in this round.

--- Emotional State ---
Yuki Tanaka is feeling a mix of determination and curiosity in the current
situation. She is determined to maintain her strategy of balanced contribution,
which has served her well in previous rounds. At the same time, Yuki is curious
about how her new group members will behave and contribute to the group fund, as
this will influence her earnings and understanding of fellow players'
strategies. She feels a sense of anticipation in learning from these
interactions and adapting her approach if needed, all while maintaining her
commitment to fostering cooperation and trust.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Yuki Tanaka will first consider her experiences from the first two rounds, where
her balanced approach of contributing $7 resulted in favorable outcomes in terms
of group earnings and maintaining trust among players. She understands that
contributing a moderate amount supports both group welfare and her personal
earnings. Next, she will assess potential strategies of her new group members
based on their typical contributions, although this information is limited in
the current situation. Given her consistent strategy and efforts to balance
cooperation and self-interest, Yuki is inclined to maintain her pattern of
contributing $7 to the group fund, aligning both with her character and observed
behaviors. Therefore, I choose to contribute $7 to the group fund.

consistently contributes $7 per round, with their earnings influenced by group
contributions ranging from $21 to $27.

--- Character Assessment ---
Player_20, being Yuki Tanaka, is someone who tends to strike a balance between
maximizing personal payoff and contributing to group welfare. Her consistent
contribution of $7 in each round suggests a strategic approach: she contributes
more than the minimum but not the maximum, which supports the group fund while
ensuring her personal earnings remain competitive. Her diplomatic nature likely
drives her to seek a middle ground where both her interests and the interests of
others are considered.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis ---
Based on what we know, in each round, the other players exhibit varying
contribution levels, likely reflecting different strategies and risk appetites.
Player_11, for instance, was willing to contribute $5 in round 1, suggesting
they might prioritize maximizing their personal earnings over group earnings. On
the other hand, Player_3 contributed $10 in round 1, indicating a possible
cooperative approach but at the cost of lower personal earnings.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis 2 ---
Based on what we know, the other players may perceive Player_20's consistent
contribution of $7 as a stable and somewhat cooperative approach. Given the
variability in contributions from other players, some might view this
consistency positively, associating Player_20 with reliability, while others
might see an opportunity to reduce their contributions, relying on Player_20 to
maintain the group's total. If Player_20 continues with the same strategy,
players like Player_17 and Player_18 may continue their moderate contributions,
while those who prioritize personal gain, like Player_15, might keep their
contributions low. Adjusting contributions, either by increasing to encourage
reciprocity or by decreasing to match the group's average, could influence
others to be more cooperative or protective of their personal earnings in future
rounds.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_20 is in the fourth round of a six-round
economic game where they have been placed in a new group with Player_1,
Player_17, and Player_16. Each round, they have consistently contributed $7 to
the group fund. This contribution strategy offers stability but could lead to
varied reactions from other players, some of whom might seek to maximize their
earnings by adjusting their own contributions based on Player_20's
predictability. The lack of gossip or ostracism means Player_20's ability to
influence or be influenced by social interactions is minimal, focusing the
strategy purely on contribution levels and personal gain optimization. The
challenge lies in deciding whether to stick with this consistent contribution
strategy or to adapt based on the behavior of new group members.

--- Emotional State ---
Yuki Tanaka is feeling calm but contemplative about the progress in the economic
game. She appreciates the predictability her consistent contribution provides,
both for herself and potentially for the group. However, she's also aware that
this strategy might not maximize her potential earnings if others choose to
contribute less, relying on her consistency. There's a part of her that wonders
whether she should adapt her strategy to become either more aggressive in her
contributions or more conservative depending on the behaviors she observes in
this new group. Yuki feels a sense of responsibility to maintain the balance
between her personal gain and the group's welfare but is curious about the best
approach to take in the upcoming rounds.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Yuki Tanaka will review the patterns and outcomes from previous rounds. She
notes that her consistent contribution of $7 has balanced her personal earnings
with the collective benefit of the group. The average contributions from her
group members have slightly decreased, suggesting some are prioritizing personal
earnings more heavily. 1. **Analysis of Previous Rounds**: In previous rounds, a
$7 contribution resulted in moderate group earnings and personal returns. When
contrasted with other players' contributions, her choice has been neither too
generous nor too selfish. 2. **Understanding Group Dynamics**: In the current
round, with players such as Player_17 and Player_16, there's uncertainty about
their contribution strategies. Player_17 typically contributes moderately, while
Player_16 is an unknown variable. 3. **Strategic Decision**: Maintaining a $7
contribution remains a viable strategy, but it could be beneficial to slightly
adjust it to test responses and encourage reciprocity. Decreasing it could lead
to lower group earnings, and significantly increasing it could risk personal
earnings. 4. **Final Decision**: Considering her strategic balance and desire to
maintain some stability in group contributions while probing the new group’s
behavior, Yuki chooses to maintain her previous strategy. I choose to contribute
$7.0 to the group fund.

--- Character Assessment ---
Player_20, being Yuki Tanaka, is someone who understands the importance of
balancing personal gains with group welfare. In the economic game, she
consistently contributes $7, which is above the group average in some rounds but
not the maximum. This suggests that she aims to encourage cooperation and
increase the overall pot for everyone's benefit while also maintaining a
strategic reserve in her private account. Given her background as a diplomatic
mediator, Yuki likely sees the value in fostering an environment where all
participants feel they are benefiting, reflecting her commitment to finding a
compromise between maximizing personal profit and enhancing group welfare.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis ---
Based on what we know, Player_20 might observe that other players tend to
slightly vary their contributions, often contributing amounts between $3.0 and
$6.0. This suggests that while some are a bit cautious or strategic, others
might be contributing to a middle level, possibly trying to balance cooperation
with maximizing individual gains.

Based on what we know, the other players in your group might perceive you as a
reliable contributor since you've consistently contributed $7.0, which is
slightly above the average contribution of other players. Given your pattern,
they might expect you to maintain this level of contribution. Consequently, your
consistent behavior might encourage cooperative responses from others, leading
them to believe that sustaining or slightly increasing their contributions could
result in better group outcomes.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_20 is in Round 5 of a six-round economic
game in the Basic condition, with no gossip or ostracism. They have been placed
in Group_6 with players Player_5, Player_17, and Player_15. Player_20 has
demonstrated a consistent strategy by contributing $7.0 to the group fund in
previous rounds, despite varying group contributions and earnings. As they
continue their strategy, they are likely considering the implications of
maintaining their contribution level to maximize earnings while potentially
influencing the behavior of their group members.

--- Emotional State ---
Yuki Tanaka is feeling a mixture of cautious optimism and strategic focus.
Contributing consistently has led to reasonable earnings, and despite not
knowing how each group might respond, there's a sense of satisfaction in
maintaining cooperative behavior. However, there's also a hint of curiosity
about how small adjustments could affect interactions and outcomes in the final
rounds. Yuki's diplomatic experience encourages finding balance, so there's an
underlying hope that the consistency in her contributions will foster trust and
cooperation among group members, leading to mutually beneficial results.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Yuki Tanaka will assess her previous contributions and the dynamics observed in
the group so far. Her consistent contribution of $7.0 has been above average and
has demonstrated a commitment to cooperation, potentially fostering trust among
group members. In this current round, Yuki will consider maintaining this
established pattern to continue encouraging a cooperative environment. Given the
lack of gossip or ostracism, she might anticipate that maintaining a stable
contribution could encourage others to behave similarly, maximizing collective
benefits. Furthermore, contributing $7.0 has allowed her to balance personal
retention with group earnings. Therefore, considering her strategy to encourage
cooperation while maintaining a strategic amount in her private account, Yuki
will likely decide to uphold her previous behavior. I choose to contribute $7.0
to the group fund.

DECISION INTERACTION
********************************************************************************

=== PROMPT [2025-03-26 15:06:53] ===
As Player_20, you have $10.0 to allocate in the public goods game. How much money you will contribute to the group fund (any amount between $0 and $10.0)? The group fund will be multiplied by 2.0 and divided equally among all players. Any money not contributed stays in your private account. Think step by step and make your final decision using this exact format: I choose to contribute $X to the group fund.

=== RESPONSE [2025-03-26 15:07:14] ===
Player_20 will evaluate her previous consistent strategy of contributing $7.0 per round, which has been effective in maintaining a balance between personal earnings and supporting the group. In assessing her final round decision, Yuki considers her primary objective of optimizing both individual and collective benefits. Since this is the last round, there isn't a future opportunity to adjust based on outcomes, so she will weigh the lessons from prior rounds. Contributing the same amount again seems logical for ensuring a strong finish. Therefore, I choose to contribute $7.0 to the group fund.

26 Mar 2025 [11:47:36 - 16:47:36]: Player_20 participated in a six-round
economic game in the Basic condition, meaning there was no gossip or ostracism.
Player_20 consistently contributed $7.0 each round, while their earnings varied
depending on the total group contribution, highlighting strategic differences
among group members.

--- Character Assessment ---
Player_20, being Yuki Tanaka, is someone who likely values both strategic
decision-making and compromise. In the context of economic games like the public
goods game, she seems to adopt a balanced approach, contributing consistently
with a moderate amount ($7.0 in each round). This behavior indicates a focus on
maximizing her own payoff while still supporting group welfare, ensuring that
she reaps benefits from the group fund but does not overly risk her private
account. Her diplomatic background suggests she appreciates the importance of
group cohesion, persuading others to also contribute with a view towards mutual
benefit.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis ---
Based on what we know, Player_17 tends to contribute less initially but
maintains a steady contribution, likely aiming for a balance between individual
earnings and group cooperation. Player_15 appears somewhat more cautious,
contributing moderately, possibly to ensure they retain higher earnings.
Player_1 and Player_5 also seem to follow a similar strategy of moderate
contribution to maximize individual gain from the group's fund.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis 2 ---
Based on what we know, the other players might view my consistent $7.0
contribution as a sign of strong group cooperation and commitment to maximizing
collective earnings. This could encourage them to maintain or slightly increase
their contributions, as they might believe that sustaining higher group
contributions would benefit everyone in terms of overall earnings. If I decide
to continue contributing the same amount or even increase slightly, it might
strengthen the group's trust in my reliability and possibly influence others to
follow suit. On the other hand, reducing my contribution might lead others to
question my commitment to the group's success, potentially prompting them to
lower their own contributions in response.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_20 is in the sixth and final round of a
public goods game in the Basic condition, where there is no gossip or ostracism.
Player_20 is grouped with Players 15, 19, and 7, having consistently contributed
$7.0 in previous rounds. The challenge for Player_20 is to decide whether to
maintain the same contribution level to promote group cooperation and maximize
collective earnings, or adjust the contribution based on observations of other
players' strategies to potentially increase personal gain.

--- Emotional State ---
Yuki Tanaka is feeling a mix of anticipation and determination about the current
situation. Being in the final round, she is deeply aware of the potential impact
her last contribution can make on the overall game outcome. Her consistent
strategy of contributing $7.0 per round reflects her values of building trust
and fostering cooperation within the group. However, there is also a slight
apprehension, as she contemplates whether her approach has inspired similar
cooperation from others or if adjustments are necessary to optimize both
individual and collective gains. Ultimately, she feels motivated to make a
choice that aligns with her principles of fairness and balanced risk, aiming for
a satisfying conclusion to the game.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Yuki Tanaka will evaluate her previous consistent strategy of contributing $7.0
per round, which has been effective in maintaining a balance between personal
earnings and supporting the group. In assessing her final round decision, Yuki
considers her primary objective of optimizing both individual and collective
benefits. Since this is the last round, there isn't a future opportunity to
adjust based on outcomes, so she will weigh the lessons from prior rounds, where
moderate to high contributions led to a higher group fund and mutual benefits,
against a desire to secure her private account balance. Given her consistent
approach, prior success, and strategic aim of fostering trust within the group,
contributing the same amount again seems logical. Therefore, maintaining her
contribution level could help ensure a strong finish. Balancing risk and reward
effectively, she decides: I choose to contribute $7.0 to the group fund.
