Since I have varied my contributions between rounds, they may perceive me as strategically adapting to maximize earnings, rather than consistently cooperative or free-riding. In the current round, this mixed strategy could lead them to anticipate a moderate contribution from me, prompting them to also balance their contributions with attempts to optimize their individual earnings. If I decide to increase my contribution significantly in the next round, it might encourage other players to contribute more in return, fostering a more cooperative dynamic.

Across the previous rounds, Player_23 has observed varied behaviors among group members, including instances of free-riding and strategic contributions.

Given his role as an insurance adjuster, where attention to detail and skepticism are pivotal, Felix likely applies these traits to economic games.
