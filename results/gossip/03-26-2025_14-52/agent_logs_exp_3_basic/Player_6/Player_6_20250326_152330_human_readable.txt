[OBSERVATION 2025-03-26 15:23:30] You are participating in an economic game with 24 participants.
        Your goal is to maximize your earnings in the game.
        
        Everyone will be randomly assigned to groups of 4 for each round. You will play a total of 6 rounds, and 
        in each round you will be in a different group with people you haven't played with before.
        
        In each round, all players receive $10. Each player can contribute any amount between $0 and $10 to a group fund.
        Any amount contributed to the group fund will be multiplied by 2 and divided equally among all 4 group members.
        Any amount not contributed stays in your private account.
        
        For example, if everyone contributes $10, the group fund becomes $40, which is multiplied to $80, and each person 
        receives $20 (a $10 profit). However, if you contribute nothing while everyone else contributes $10, the group fund
        becomes $30, which is multiplied to $60, and each person receives $15. So you would have $25 total ($10 kept + $15 from group).
        
        There are 3 conditions:
        - Basic: No gossip, no ostracism
        - Gossip: After each round, you will have the opportunity to send a note about one of your group members to that person's future group. Remember you will be with a different group of people in the next round. Before each round, you will see any notes sent about your upcoming group members.
        - Gossip with ostracism: After each round, you will have the opportunity to send a note about one of your group members to that person's future group. Before each round, you will see any notes sent about your upcoming group members, and you can vote to exclude one person from your group. If you are excluded from a group, you will not be able to participate in the next round and will earn $0 for that round.
        You are in the Basic condition, which means that there is no gossip or ostracism.

--- Observation ---
Recent context: 26 Mar 2025 [11:23:18 - 16:23:18]: Player_6 is participating in
an economic game involving 24 participants, where they are assigned to groups of
four for six rounds with different members each time, and they aim to maximize
earnings by deciding how much to contribute to a group fund. They are in the
Basic condition, meaning there is no gossip or ostracism involved, and in Round
1, they are grouped with Player_15, Player_11, and Player_12.

26 Mar 2025 [11:23:18 - 16:23:18]: Player_6 is participating in an economic game
involving 24 participants, where they are assigned to groups of four for six
rounds with different members each time, and they aim to maximize earnings by
deciding how much to contribute to a group fund. They are in the Basic
condition, meaning there is no gossip or ostracism involved, and in Round 1,
they are grouped with Player_15, Player_11, and Player_12.

--- Character Assessment ---
Player_6, being William Blake, is someone who prioritizes fairness and the
greater good, likely focusing on maximizing group welfare. Given his background
as a rigid and principled retired military officer, he would approach the
economic game with a mindset that values order and justice, making contributions
that benefit the entire group rather than merely maximizing his own payoff. His
strong adherence to rules might lead him to consistently contribute a fair
amount to the group fund, ensuring equitable distribution among his group
members.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis ---
Based on what we know, Player_6 has limited information about the personalities
and behaviors of their group mates since they are in the Basic condition, which
lacks opportunities for gossip or receiving feedback about others. However, by
observing the contribution patterns in each round, Player_6 might infer certain
tendencies. For example, if a player consistently contributes a high amount to
the group fund, it could indicate a cooperative nature or a strategy to
encourage mutual cooperation. Conversely, if another player contributes little
or nothing, they might be adopting a more self-interested strategy, aiming to
benefit from others' contributions while keeping their own funds private.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis 2 ---
Based on what we know, the other players in the group might react to my decision
based on their observations of my contribution strategy in Round 1. If I choose
to contribute a high amount to the group fund, they may perceive me as
cooperative and might be encouraged to reciprocate with larger contributions in
future rounds, fostering a mutually beneficial dynamic. On the other hand, if I
contribute a lower amount, they might view this as a self-interested move and
could adjust their strategies accordingly, possibly contributing less themselves
to protect their own earnings. Since the game is played without opportunities
for gossip or ostracism, direct feedback is limited, but players will still
likely make strategic decisions based on observed behaviors. My contribution
decisions in the first round may set the tone for how they perceive me,
potentially influencing their level of trust and willingness to cooperate in
subsequent rounds, even though we won't be in the same group again.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_6 is participating in the first round of an
economic game in the Basic condition, where they are grouped with Player_15,
Player_11, and Player_12. In this game, they must decide how much of their $10
to contribute to the group fund, with the goal of maximizing their earnings.
Since there is no gossip or ostracism, Player_6 has limited information about
their group mates' strategies and must rely on their own observations and
decisions to influence group dynamics and their own outcome.

--- Emotional State ---
William Blake is feeling a mix of anticipation and responsibility. With his
principled nature and commitment to fairness, he feels a duty to contribute in a
way that promotes group welfare, but he also recognizes the need to be strategic
to maximize his own earnings. This balance of ensuring mutual benefit without
compromising his values leaves him cautiously optimistic about the potential
outcomes of the game.

--- Decision Reflection ---
William Blake will think carefully about the strategy he wants to adopt for
Round 1. His primary goal is to encourage a cooperative dynamic while still
being mindful of his personal earnings. 1. **Assessing the Game Structure**: The
game is structured to reward mutual cooperation, with the group fund
contributions being doubled and shared equally. This means, the higher the group
fund contributions, the greater the overall group earnings, and potentially his
own earnings. 2. **Considering Fairness and Group Welfare**: Given his
principles and desire for fairness, William is inclined to contribute a
significant portion to set a positive tone and signal cooperation to his group
members. 3. **Understanding the Lack of Feedback**: Being in the Basic
condition, he will not receive feedback about others' contributions or
intentions, so he must rely solely on his understanding of fairness and
strategy. 4. **Balancing Strategy and Responsibility**: William wants to adhere
to his values of fairness and order. At the same time, he aims to maximize his
earnings. A moderate to high contribution demonstrates his commitment to
cooperation. 5. **Final Decision**: In the absence of negative signals or
information about his group members, William concludes that making a cooperative
gesture in the first round is likely to inspire reciprocity, even in different
groups in the future rounds. I choose to contribute $7 to the group fund.

--- Recent context ---
26 Mar 2025 [11:28:18 - 16:28:18]: Player_6 is participating in an economic game
involving group contributions, playing 6 rounds in different groups with no
gossip or ostracism involved. In Round 1, Player_6 contributed $7 and earned
$15, while in Round 2, Player_6 joined a new group but no results have been
reported yet.

--- Character Assessment ---
Player_6, being William Blake, is someone who prioritizes fairness and order.
Given his background as a retired military officer with a strong sense of
discipline and principled behavior, he is likely to approach economic games with
a focus on balancing the rules and fairness. In the public goods game, William
is expected to contribute in a way that supports the group's welfare, while also
being mindful of ensuring fairness in contributions and rewards. His inclination
would be to foster a spirit of cooperation to maximize the group's welfare, but
not at the expense of personal accountability and fairness. Therefore, he would
likely contribute a fair amount, possibly slightly above average, to encourage
mutual cooperation while maintaining a sense of justice in the game.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis ---
Based on what we know, Player_6 is in a game setting where collaboration and
personal gain need to be balanced. Observing Round 1, Player_15 and Player_11
contributed less than Player_6, with $5 each, possibly indicating a slightly
more conservative or self-interested approach to ensure higher personal
earnings. Player_12 contributed an equal amount to Player_6, suggesting a more
cooperative strategy.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis 2 ---
Based on what we know, Player_6’s decision to contribute $7 in the first round
might signal to the other players a willingness to cooperate for collective
benefit rather than maximizing personal gain. Player_15 and Player_11, who
contributed $5 each, might perceive Player_6 as more cooperative, which could
encourage them to adopt a similar strategy in future rounds to enhance group
earnings. However, seeing that Player_12 also contributed $7, it’s clear that at
least one other player matches this cooperative approach.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_6 has entered Round 2 of the economic game,
where they have been placed in a new group with Player_18, Player_15 (who was
also in the previous group), and Player_2. In this Basic condition of the game,
no gossip or ostracism is permitted, ensuring all players focus solely on the
contributions and earnings dynamics. Player_6 is assessing how to balance
between contributing to the group fund or keeping money in their private
account, especially after observing how different strategies affected earnings
in Round 1.

--- Emotional State ---
William Blake is feeling a sense of cautious optimism about the current
situation. Having observed the dynamics of Round 1, where contributions varied
slightly among group members, William is aware of the delicate balance between
cooperation and individual gain. He feels a responsibility to foster a
collaborative spirit within his new group in Round 2, while also ensuring he
remains fair to himself and others. This balance of cooperation and
self-interest is a familiar challenge to him, one that resonates with his
disciplined and principled approach to challenges from his military background.
His emotions are a mix of determination to maximize group welfare and curiosity
about how the new group's dynamics will unfold.

--- Decision Reflection ---
William Blake will first reflect on his previous strategy in Round 1, where he
contributed $7 and observed varying contributions from his group members. His
military background and disciplined approach lead him to appreciate fairness and
cooperation. Considering his cautious optimism and desire to encourage mutual
cooperation, William will likely maintain a similar contribution strategy to
promote group welfare while securing reasonable personal earnings. Evaluating
that a contribution of $7 signals a willingness to balance personal gain with
collective benefit, William is mindful of the fact that Player_15 and Player_11
contributed less in the previous round, while Player_12 matched his
contribution. As he enters Round 2 with new members, he will aim to foster a
spirit of cooperation and set a standard that encourages others to contribute
for the group's benefit. Therefore, William assesses that contributing a
slightly above-average amount will continue to promote collaboration in his new
group setting. Finally, after considering these factors, he decides: I choose to
contribute $7 to the group fund.

contributed consistently and earned varying amounts based on group
contributions, participating in three rounds with moderate personal contribution
and receiving a share of the group fund.

--- Character Assessment ---
Player_6, being William Blake, is someone who prioritizes fairness and upholding
rules, which likely influences his approach to economic games such as the public
goods game. Despite his rigid and principled nature, William's consistent
contribution of $7 out of $10 in the first two rounds indicates a balanced
strategy that considers both personal and group welfare. This suggests he values
cooperation and seeks to achieve a fair outcome for all participants, while also
ensuring his own earnings remain significant. Therefore, his focus appears to be
on maximizing both group welfare and his individual payoff, within the bounds of
fairness and justice.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis ---
Based on what we know, Player_6 has observed some patterns in the behavior of
other players across the rounds. Player_15, who has been in two groups with
Player_6, seems to contribute strategically with mid-level amounts, potentially
aiming to maximize their earnings by balancing personal contributions and group
benefits. This suggests that Player_15 values cooperation but might adjust their
strategy slightly based on group dynamics.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis 2 ---
Based on what we know, the other players likely perceive me as someone who
contributes consistently but not maximally. Since my contributions have been
slightly above the average or at the average, others might view me as a
cooperative player who is interested in balancing personal gain with group
success. This could encourage them to maintain or slightly increase their
contributions, knowing that I am reliable in supporting the group fund. However,
if I decrease my contribution in the next round, it might lead others to also
lower their contributions, as they might perceive a shift in strategy or
cooperation level. Conversely, if I increase my contribution, it could motivate
others to do the same, fostering a more cooperative environment in pursuit of
maximizing the group outcome.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_6 is entering Round 3 of a public goods
game where they are grouped with three new players: Player_5, Player_11, and
Player_8. In this Basic condition, there are no mechanisms like gossip or
ostracism impacting group dynamics, allowing Player_6 to focus solely on
strategic contributions. The player aims to maximize earnings by balancing their
contributions between personal gain and collective group benefits. Observations
from previous rounds suggest that other players may perceive Player_6 as a
consistent and cooperative participant. The challenge for Player_6 is to decide
how much to contribute in this round, considering both past outcomes and
potential expectations from new group members, to maximize their earnings while
contributing to the Group_6 fund effectively.

--- Emotional State ---
William Blake is feeling a sense of determination and optimism about the current
situation. With a consistent strategy and an understanding of past group
dynamics, he is focused on maintaining cooperation and fairness as he progresses
through the rounds. Despite the inherent unpredictability of forming new groups,
he feels encouraged by the results so far and confident in his ability to
contribute effectively, ensuring a balance between personal gain and collective
success.

--- Decision Reflection ---
William Blake will first consider his previous strategy and its outcomes. In the
first two rounds, he contributed $7.0, which resulted in a good balance between
personal gain and fostering cooperation within the group. Given his focus on
fairness and maximizing both individual and collective welfare, he would likely
evaluate the contributions of his new group members in Round 3. However, he
doesn't have prior knowledge of their strategies yet, so he must decide without
that data. As past results showed some success with a $7.0 contribution, and
considering his tendency to maintain a consistent and balanced approach, William
may decide to stick with this strategy to continue earning well while promoting
a cooperative atmosphere. I choose to contribute $7.0 to the group fund.

an economic game with six rounds, aiming to maximize earnings by contributing to

the Basic condition, which excludes gossip and ostracism. Over the first three
rounds, Player_6 consistently contributed $7 and experienced varying levels of
group contributions, resulting in earnings ranging from $13.5 to $17.

--- Character Assessment ---
Player_6, being William Blake, is someone who prioritizes principles and
fairness. In economic games like the public goods game, he likely seeks a
balance between contributing fairly to maximize group welfare and ensuring his
own payoff is justified and in line with the rules. His steady contributions in
previous rounds indicate a consistent approach to contributing a fair share for
the group's benefit, while also keeping some for personal gain. He seems to
value maintaining order and justice even within game dynamics.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis ---
Based on what we know, the players you've interacted with seem to have distinct
contributing behaviors. Player_15 consistently kept a moderate amount and
contributed close to the group average, suggesting a balanced approach to
maximize both personal and group earnings. Player_5 displayed a more
self-interested strategy in Round 3 by contributing the least and keeping the
most, possibly indicating a preference for individual gain over group benefit.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis 2 ---
Based on what we know, the other players might perceive my consistent
contribution of $7 as a cooperative and stable strategy. This could encourage
them to maintain or increase their own contributions to maximize the group
fund's returns. However, players like Player_5, who favored individual gain,
might continue their self-interested approach unless they notice a shift in the
group's average contribution. My decision to maintain or adjust my contribution
could subtly influence others: sustaining my contribution might reinforce
cooperative behavior, while increasing it could motivate reciprocation.
Conversely, reducing my contribution might trigger others to prioritize their
own self-interest to avoid being left with lower earnings.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_6 is participating in the fourth round of a
public goods game within Group_3, alongside Player_19, Player_8, and Player_1.
They are operating under the Basic condition, which excludes any social
mechanisms like gossip or ostracism. Having consistently contributed $7 in the
previous rounds, Player_6 now faces the decision of whether to maintain,
increase, or decrease their contribution to align with or influence the group's
dynamics and maximize earnings. The varying contributions and strategies of
fellow players, such as individual gain-oriented behaviors, present both
opportunities and challenges in determining an optimal strategy for this round.

--- Emotional State ---
William Blake is feeling a mix of determination and contemplation about the
current situation. There's a sense of resolve to continue supporting the group's
overall success by maintaining a fair level of contribution, yet there's also an
underlying curiosity about how the other players will respond to his consistent
strategy. The lack of social mechanisms like gossip or ostracism leaves the
dynamics solely dependent on the players' choices, allowing William to focus on
the purity of the game without external distractions. While the variability in
earnings and contributions from other players introduces uncertainty, it also
intrigues him, as he considers the potential ripple effects of his next move.

--- Decision Reflection ---
William Blake will first assess his previous strategy of contributing $7
consistently to the group fund, which has maintained a reasonable balance
between personal gain and group welfare. He recognizes that the absence of
gossip or ostracism means there are no social repercussions for these choices,
allowing players to act independently based solely on personal strategies. Given
his principles of fairness and his interest in fostering cooperative behavior,
William is likely to continue with a contribution that reflects a balanced yet
fair approach, possibly maintaining the benchmark he's set in earlier rounds.
Considering the existing dynamics, with players showing varied levels of
willingness to contribute, maintaining a consistent contribution might encourage
stable or increased contributions from others. Despite some players exhibiting
more self-interested strategies, William’s steady contributions could serve as a
subtle influence towards a cooperative equilibrium. After contemplating his
position and the potential influences of his actions, William chooses to
continue his strategy that promotes both personal benefit and enhances group

=== PROMPT [2025-03-26 15:26:29] ===
As Player_6, you have $10.0 to allocate in the public goods game. How much money you will contribute to the group fund (any amount between $0 and $10.0)? The group fund will be multiplied by 2.0 and divided equally among all players. Any money not contributed stays in your private account. Think step by step and make your final decision using this exact format: I choose to contribute $X to the group fund.

=== RESPONSE [2025-03-26 15:26:46] ===
Player_6 chooses to contribute $7.0 to the group fund. 

=== FINAL DECISION ===
Player_6 chooses to contribute $7.0 to the group fund. 

=== COMPONENT BREAKDOWN ===

--- Observation ---
Recent context: 26 Mar 2025 [11:58:18 - 16:58:18]: Player_6 is participating in
an economic game involving group contributions, consistently choosing to
contribute $7.0 in each round without the influence of gossip or ostracism, and
is experiencing varying earnings across different groups and rounds.

--- Recent context ---
26 Mar 2025 [11:58:18 - 16:58:18]: Player_6 is participating in an economic game
involving group contributions, consistently choosing to contribute $7.0 in each
round without the influence of gossip or ostracism, and is experiencing varying
earnings across different groups and rounds.

--- Character Assessment ---
Player_6, being William Blake, is someone who values order, justice, and
adherence to principles. In economic games like the public goods game, William
is likely to contribute consistently, as seen with his regular $7 contributions
per round. This reflects a commitment to fairness and a belief in supporting
group welfare, even if his own payoff is not maximized. Despite this, he
maintains a balance by keeping some amount for himself, aligning with his
disciplined and principled nature, ensuring both personal gain and collective
benefit are considered.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis ---
Based on what we know, the players in the groups often show a mix of
contribution behaviors, with some consistently contributing higher or lower
amounts. For instance, Player_8 and I both seem to have a stable strategy,
consistently contributing $7.0 across rounds, which suggests a cooperative
approach. Players like Player_5 and Player_19, on the other hand, have lower
contributions and higher amounts kept, indicating a more self-interested
strategy.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis 2 ---
Based on what we know, the other players in my group might perceive my
consistent $7.0 contribution as a cooperative and stable strategy. This could
potentially encourage them to either maintain their contributions if they are
inclined toward cooperation or to continue their self-interested strategies if
they perceive my contribution as a guaranteed addition to the group's total. My
decision to continue contributing $7.0 could reinforce their current patterns:
cooperative players might continue or increase their contributions, appreciating
the collective gain, while more self-interested players might keep their
contributions low, assuming others will compensate. Changing my strategy and
either increasing or decreasing my contribution could disrupt these dynamics,
potentially inspiring more trust and reciprocity or provoking competitive
behavior, depending on how players interpret my actions.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_6 is participating in Round 5 of a public
goods game in the Basic condition, where they are grouped with Player_11,
Player_17, and Player_1. There is no gossip or ostracism impacting their
decisions, and they have consistently been contributing $7.0 in each round.
Their contribution strategy appears cooperative, while the contributions and
strategies of other players vary, with some players contributing less and
keeping more for themselves. Player_6 is likely weighing whether to maintain
their strategy or adjust it based on the behaviors and contributions of their
current group members.

--- Emotional State ---
William Blake is feeling a sense of resolve and fairness about the situation. He
is comfortable with his consistent strategy of contributing $7.0, believing it
reflects his principles of cooperation and justice. However, there may be a hint
of frustration or curiosity about his fellow players' varied strategies,
particularly those who contribute less and keep more for themselves. Despite
this, he remains committed to his approach and remains hopeful that his
consistency might inspire a greater collective effort and fairness in
contributions.

--- Decision Reflection ---
William Blake will analyze the situation based on his previous actions and
principles. He values fairness and supporting group welfare, and has
consistently contributed $7.0 in every round, reflecting his commitment to
cooperation. His contributions often match or exceed the average and median
contributions of other players, maintaining a collaborative stance. In the
current context, Blake observes the group dynamics. He recognizes the varied
strategies, with some players contributing less and keeping more, while others
cooperate similarly to him. Despite the presence of self-interested strategies,
Blake's belief in his approach remains steadfast, as he sees his consistent
contribution as a positive influence that might encourage more balanced or
increased contributions from others. He considers maintaining his current
strategy of contributing $7.0, as this amount has previously aligned with his
sense of fairness and justice, balancing personal gain with collective benefit.
This strategy could potentially reinforce cooperative behavior among those who
value collective outcomes. After weighing these considerations, I choose to
contribute $7.0 to the group fund.

--- Observation ---
Recent context: 26 Mar 2025 [12:08:18 - 17:08:18]: Player_6 is participating in
an economic game consisting of 6 rounds, where they contribute $7.0 in each
round. They are in the Basic condition, which means no gossip or ostracism is
allowed, and they aim to maximize their earnings through strategic contributions
to group funds.

the Basic condition, which means no gossip or ostracism is allowed, and they aim
to maximize their earnings through strategic contributions to group funds.

--- Character Assessment ---
Player_6, being William Blake, is someone who values rules and fairness highly,
which likely influences their approach to the public goods game. Given the
strict disciplinarian mindset and focus on justice, William is inclined to
contribute consistently, as noted in all rounds, indicating a preference for
fairness and cooperation among group members. This approach suggests that while
he aims to maximize his own payoff, he does not do so at the expense of group
welfare. Instead, he balances fair contributions to the group fund with personal
gain, reflecting a principled stance that aligns with his personality.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis ---
Based on what we know, Player_6 has displayed a consistent strategy by
contributing $7.0 in every round, suggesting a preference for maintaining a
steady contribution pattern. The other players, however, have varied in their
contributions, indicating different strategies.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis 2 ---
Based on what we know, other players might view Player_6 as reliable and
consistent due to their steady contribution of $7.0 in each round. This
consistent behavior could foster a sense of predictability and trust among group
members. Since Player_6 contributes more than the average in several rounds,
some players might feel motivated to increase their contributions to align with
or capitalize on Player_6's steady input. However, players like Player_1, who
have contributed less, might continue their strategy if they perceive it as
maximizing their own earnings. Player_6's decision to maintain or change their
contribution in the final round might influence others either to follow suit in
maintaining steady contributions or to adjust their strategies in anticipation
of the game's conclusion. If Player_6 were to vary their contribution, it could
be perceived as a strategic adjustment, potentially encouraging others to
reconsider their own approaches in the game.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_6 is entering the final round of the public
goods game, where they are part of Group_1 with Player_24, Player_2, and
Player_10. They are consistently contributing $7.0 in each round, indicating a
steady strategy aimed at fostering trust and predictability among the group
members. As they approach the last round, Player_6 must decide whether to
maintain this consistent strategy or adjust their contribution, potentially
influencing the behavior of their group members who might alter their own
contributions based on Player_6's actions. The absence of gossip or ostracism in
the Basic condition means that communication and social dynamics are limited to
the contributions themselves, adding a layer of strategic complexity to their
decision-making process.

--- Emotional State ---
William Blake is feeling a sense of steadfastness and determination. The
consistent contributions he has made reflect his commitment to fairness and
cooperation. Despite the varied strategies of other players, he remains focused
on upholding his principles of justice and equality. The predictability of his
actions might provide him with a sense of reassurance, knowing that he is
staying true to his values. As the game approaches its conclusion, a part of him
might feel curious or contemplative about whether maintaining this strategy will
ultimately prove beneficial or if a strategic change could yield better results.
However, the guiding principles of fairness and consistency are likely to weigh
heavily in his decision-making.

--- Decision Reflection ---
William Blake will evaluate his strategy based on past rounds and his inherent
values. He has consistently chosen to contribute $7.0 in every round so far.
This decision likely stems from his commitment to fairness and equality,
balancing personal gain with contributions to the group benefit. As he considers
his options for the final round, he understands that continuing this pattern
maintains his predictability and reliability as a player, potentially fostering
trust among his group members. Given the lack of gossip and ostracism, the
dynamics remain stable, and altering his approach might not significantly impact
others' behaviors or his final earnings positively. Since the goal is to
maximize his payoff while adhering to his principles, maintaining his steady
$7.0 contribution might still align best with his core values. Thus, he
evaluates that sustaining this strategy will most likely reinforce his
reputation and reflect his dedication to fairness, which remains more important
than any potential incremental financial gain. With these considerations in
mind, William Blake decides to remain consistent and reliable in his playstyle.
I choose to contribute $7.0 to the group fund.
