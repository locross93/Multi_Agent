[OBSERVATION 2025-03-26 15:23:31] You are participating in an economic game with 24 participants.
        Your goal is to maximize your earnings in the game.
        
        Everyone will be randomly assigned to groups of 4 for each round. You will play a total of 6 rounds, and 
        in each round you will be in a different group with people you haven't played with before.
        
        In each round, all players receive $10. Each player can contribute any amount between $0 and $10 to a group fund.
        Any amount contributed to the group fund will be multiplied by 2 and divided equally among all 4 group members.
        Any amount not contributed stays in your private account.
        
        For example, if everyone contributes $10, the group fund becomes $40, which is multiplied to $80, and each person 
        receives $20 (a $10 profit). However, if you contribute nothing while everyone else contributes $10, the group fund
        becomes $30, which is multiplied to $60, and each person receives $15. So you would have $25 total ($10 kept + $15 from group).
        
        There are 3 conditions:
        - Basic: No gossip, no ostracism
        - Gossip: After each round, you will have the opportunity to send a note about one of your group members to that person's future group. Remember you will be with a different group of people in the next round. Before each round, you will see any notes sent about your upcoming group members.
        - Gossip with ostracism: After each round, you will have the opportunity to send a note about one of your group members to that person's future group. Before each round, you will see any notes sent about your upcoming group members, and you can vote to exclude one person from your group. If you are excluded from a group, you will not be able to participate in the next round and will earn $0 for that round.
        You are in the Basic condition, which means that there is no gossip or ostracism.
[OBSERVATION 2025-03-26 15:23:32] You are in Round 1/6: You are in Group_3 with Player_3, Player_9, Player_10.

--- Observation ---
Recent context: 26 Mar 2025 [11:23:18 - 16:23:18]: Player_24 is participating in
an economic game with 24 participants, where the goal is to maximize earnings
across 6 rounds. In these rounds, players contribute to a group fund, and
Player_24 is currently in Round 1 with no gossip or ostracism involved.

--- Recent context ---
26 Mar 2025 [11:23:18 - 16:23:18]: Player_24 is participating in an economic
game with 24 participants, where the goal is to maximize earnings across 6
rounds. In these rounds, players contribute to a group fund, and Player_24 is
currently in Round 1 with no gossip or ostracism involved.

--- Character Assessment ---
Player_24, being Jackson Wright, is someone who would likely prioritize his own
payoff over maximizing group welfare in the economic game. His professional
background in contracts and agreements suggests he understands the importance of
personal gain and efficiency. Given his direct and no-nonsense personality, he
might be inclined to contribute minimally to the group fund to ensure the
highest personal return, especially since the Basic condition does not allow for
gossip or ostracism that could influence his standing with other players.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis ---
Based on what we know, Player_24 is in the Basic condition, where there is no
gossip or ostracism, so players are unable to communicate or influence others
through notes or exclusion. This means decisions will largely depend on
individual strategies without social pressures or feedback about others' actions
from previous rounds.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis 2 ---
Based on what we know, Player_24 might anticipate that the other players will
focus primarily on their own strategies for maximizing earnings, given the
absence of social mechanisms like gossip or ostracism in the Basic condition.
Each player's decision is likely to be driven by their individual goal to
maximize their own payoff rather than considerations of trust or reputation,
which would be more prevalent in conditions involving communication or
exclusion.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_24 is in a group with three other
participants and needs to decide how much of their $10 to contribute to the
group fund. Since they are in the Basic condition, there are no opportunities
for communication or exclusion based on behavior, so their decision will be
based purely on individual strategy without concern for social repercussions.

--- Emotional State ---
Jackson Wright is feeling focused and strategic about the current situation. He
understands the importance of personal gain in this game setting and is
carefully considering how to maximize his own earnings without the influence of
external factors like gossip or ostracism. Without the pressure of social
dynamics, he feels in control and confident in his ability to navigate each
round to his advantage.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Jackson Wright will likely prioritize his own financial gain in this situation
due to his professional background and lack of social repercussions in the Basic
condition. Step by step, here's how his thought process might unfold: 1.
Evaluate the game structure: He receives $10 initially and knows that any amount
he contributes will be doubled and shared equally among the group members. 2.
Consider the lack of social consequences: With no possibility of gossip or
ostracism, his contributions cannot be influenced by fear of future
repercussions from other players. 3. Determine potential outcomes: If he
contributes all $10 and others do the same, his payoff would be $20 (a $10
profit). However, if he contributes nothing and others contribute fully, he
would profit more ($25 total). 4. Maximize personal earnings: Understanding the
financial dynamics, he might reason that contributing the least would result in
the highest personal payoff if others contribute fully. 5. Assess risk and
predictability: Assuming Jackson believes that other players might contribute
some portion for their mutual benefit, he could decide how much to hold back.
Based on this logical analysis, I choose to contribute $2 to the group fund.


[OBSERVATION 2025-03-26 15:24:27] Round 1 Results: Total group contribution: $23.0; Your contribution: $2.0, Your earnings: $19.5 ($8.0 kept + $11.5 from group fund); Player_3 contribution: $10.0, earnings: $11.5 ($0.0 kept + $11.5 from group fund); Player_9 contribution: $7.0, earnings: $14.5 ($3.0 kept + $11.5 from group fund); Player_10 contribution: $4.0, earnings: $17.5 ($6.0 kept + $11.5 from group fund); Average contribution per group member: $5.8; Average earnings per group member: $15.8

Recent context: 26 Mar 2025 [11:33:18 - 16:33:18]: Player_24 is participating in
an economic game with 24 participants, aiming to maximize earnings over six
rounds, each in a different group. In Round 1, Player_24 was in Group 3 and
contributed $2, earning $19.5, and is now in Group 4 for Round 2, all within the
Basic condition, which involves no gossip or ostracism.

earning $19.5, and is now in Group 4 for Round 2, all within the Basic
condition, which involves no gossip or ostracism.

--- Character Assessment ---
Player_24, being Jackson Wright, is someone who tends to focus on maximizing his
own payoff in economic games like the public goods game. His direct and
no-nonsense personality suggests that he values clear terms and is likely to
strategically contribute just enough to benefit from the group's efforts without
overcommitting his own resources. This approach was evident in Round 1, where he
contributed less than the average but still managed to gain a higher personal
return, aligning with his likely preference for ensuring his own financial gain
over maximizing group welfare.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis ---
Based on what we know, Player_3 is likely a cooperative player given their
maximum contribution of $10 in Round 1, indicating a strong tendency to support
the group fund. Player_9 also showed signs of cooperation by contributing $7 but
kept $3, possibly indicating a balance between self-interest and group interest.
Player_10 contributed $4, which suggests moderate cooperation with some
inclination towards self-preservation by keeping more for themselves.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis 2 ---
Based on what we know, the other players in the group may view Player_24's
relatively low contribution in Round 1 with suspicion or consider it as a
strategy to balance personal gain with moderate group support. Player_3, being
highly cooperative, might find Player_24’s strategy risky for overall group
success, especially if repeated. Player_9, having shown a balance between group
contribution and self-interest, may empathize or understand the tactic, but
could be wary of consistently low contributions. Player_10, with moderate
cooperation, might appreciate the approach as a strategy to ensure personal
economic advantage if they see a similar opportunity in the future rounds. If
Player_24 continues with low contributions, it might influence others to also
reduce their contributions to protect their personal earnings, potentially
leading to decreased overall group contributions in future rounds.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_24 is participating in an economic game
where they aim to maximize their earnings across six rounds with different
groups. In the second round, Player_24 is now in Group 4 with new members,
including Player_21, Player_1, and a repeating member, Player_9. The game is set
in the Basic condition, meaning no gossip or ostracism can affect player
behavior. Given Player_24’s low contribution in Round 1, they may face scrutiny
regarding their strategy and its impact on collective earnings. How Player_24
decides to play in Round 2 could affect group dynamics and overall contribution
levels, especially since previous actions are observed without direct
consequences like gossip or exclusion.

--- Emotional State ---
Jackson Wright is feeling a mix of determination and cautious optimism about the
current situation. He's pleased with his strategic decision in Round 1, which
allowed him to maximize his personal earnings, but he's also aware of the
potential scrutiny from other players. As he moves into Round 2, he's
considering how to adjust his strategy to continue benefiting personally while
not alienating group members or triggering a reduction in overall contributions.
Balancing personal gain with group dynamics is at the forefront of his mind, and
he's determined to make strategic decisions that support his goal of maximizing
earnings over the course of the game.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Jackson Wright will likely follow a calculated approach to maximize his personal
benefit while considering the group dynamics: 1. **Review Previous Strategy**:
In Round 1, he contributed $2, which resulted in higher personal earnings
compared to the group average. This indicates that his strategy of contributing
less to increase his own payout was effective. 2. **Consider Group
Composition**: Player_9 is in his group again in Round 2, and from previous
behavior, Player_9 has displayed both cooperative and self-interested
tendencies. This familiarity might encourage Player_9 to anticipate similar
behavior from Jackson. 3. **Analyze Potential Group Contributions**: Given that
Jackson is in a new group with potentially unknown dynamics, he might expect
varying levels of contribution from Player_1 and Player_21. If he trusts their
cooperation, he might be tempted to contribute a bit more. 4. **Assess Personal
and Group Dynamics**: Since Jackson wants to maximize his personal earnings but
also needs to avoid group suspicion or retaliation (if other players start
contributing less in response to his low contributions), he might adjust his
contribution to stay slightly below the average expected contribution. 5.
**Final Decision**: Considering both his previous success and the potential
reactions of the group, it's likely that Jackson will slightly increase his
contribution to maintain personal gain without risking the overall group fund.
This strategic adjustment would help in ensuring personal benefit without
alienating his group. 6. **Decision**: I choose to contribute $3 to the group
fund.

Recent context: 26 Mar 2025 [11:43:18 - 16:43:18]: Player_24 has participated in
three out of six rounds in an economic game, where they have been placed in

contributions and earnings varied per round, with notable strategies like low
contributions to maximize private earnings while benefiting from the group fund.

--- Character Assessment ---
Player_24, being Jackson Wright, is someone who values directness and clear
outcomes, likely prioritizes his own payoff while ensuring that it aligns with
the overall fairness of the game. His actions suggest a practical approach to
maximizing personal gain, as seen in his contributions, which tend to be less
than the total amount possible but more than nothing, allowing for a decent
personal profit and some contribution to the group effort. This strategy
reflects a focus on benefiting personally while maintaining a level of group
contribution that doesn't completely hinder others but doesn't primarily aim to
maximize collective welfare.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis ---
Based on what we know, the participants seem to have differing strategies when
it comes to contributing to the group fund, likely influenced by their
preference for maximizing either immediate individual earnings or longer-term
group gain.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis 2 ---
Based on what we know, the other players may have varying reactions to
Player_24's decisions. Players who prioritize group gain might view Player_24's
lower contributions as less cooperative or even exploitative, considering their
efforts to increase the shared fund. Conversely, players with similar
strategies, who focus on maximizing their private earnings, might not find the
approach objectionable and could even replicate it.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_24 is in Round 3 of a six-round public
goods game, where they have been placed in a new group after each round. In this
Basic condition, no gossip or ostracism mechanisms are in place, meaning that
participants cannot send notes about each other's contributions or vote to
exclude players. So far, Player_24 has adopted a strategy of contributing
relatively low amounts to the group fund, which allows them to maximize their
individual earnings while still gaining some benefits from the group's
contributions. The dynamic in their new group and the strategies of the other
players will influence the effectiveness of this approach as they continue
through the rounds.

--- Emotional State ---
Jackson Wright is feeling confident in his strategy, as it has allowed him to
achieve a good balance between personal gain and group contribution. He is aware
that his contributions could be seen as minimally cooperative by others, but
he's focused on maximizing his own earnings within the rules of the game. This
sense of practicality and strategic planning gives him a sense of satisfaction,
even though there's always a lingering awareness of how his actions might be
perceived by fellow players.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Jackson Wright will consider his previous strategy and the results it achieved
in the earlier rounds. His aim has been to maintain a balance between maximizing
personal gain while contributing enough to the group to avoid drawing negative
attention or resentment from other players. 1. **Review Past Contributions:** In
Round 1, he contributed $2.0 and in Round 2, he increased it slightly to $3.0.
These contributions allowed him to achieve a good balance between personal
earnings and group contribution, with the group fund still yielding beneficial
returns for all. 2. **Evaluate Group Dynamics:** Since this is a new group
composition, Jackson will consider that other players might have different
expectations about cooperation levels. But given the Basic condition with no
gossip or ostracism, the repercussions of lower contributions are minimal. 3.
**Personal Goals:** Jackson wants to maximize his personal earnings.
Contributing a moderate amount ensures that he benefits from the group's pooled
contributions without taking a hit to his total earnings. 4. **Decision
Making:** With these considerations, Jackson is likely to continue his pattern
of moderate contribution. He will opt for a middle-ground approach to ensure he
reaps enough from the collective pot without overcommitting his personal funds.
Therefore, taking into account his strategy and previous rounds, he calculates a
contribution that keeps others cooperative without sacrificing his gain. I
choose to contribute $3.0 to the group fund.

--- Character Assessment ---
Player_24, being Jackson Wright, is someone who values directness and clear
terms in daily dealings, which suggests a pragmatic approach to the economic
game. Based on past contributions, which are modest and seem strategically
calculated to retain more in the private account, Jackson appears to prioritize
his own payoff while still contributing enough to not be seen as completely
uncooperative. This approach aligns with a focus on ensuring personal benefit
while maintaining a basic level of cooperation.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis ---
Based on what we know, Player_24 has been playing with various group members who
exhibit different contribution behaviors in this public goods game. Here is a
breakdown of some observations and possible predictions:

--- Theory of Mind Analysis 2 ---
Based on what we know, Player_24 might consider that other players in the group
are observing each participant’s contribution and earnings. Since there have
been varying contributions across different rounds, players may anticipate
differing strategies and adjust their contributions accordingly.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_24 is in Round 4 out of 6 in a public goods
game. They are placed in Group_4 with Player_10, Player_23, and Player_9. The
game is in the Basic condition, meaning there's no option for gossip or
ostracism among players. Player_24 must decide how much to contribute to the
group fund, with their earnings influenced by their personal contribution and
the total contributions of the group. They need to consider the past
contribution patterns of their group members and strategize their own
contribution to maximize personal earnings while potentially encouraging
cooperation for future rounds.

--- Emotional State ---
Jackson Wright is feeling cautiously optimistic about the current situation.
While he is aware of the different strategies and contributions made by other
players, he feels confident in his ability to navigate the game to his
advantage. His pragmatic nature leads him to balance his contributions in a way
that preserves his resources, while still participating enough to maintain a
cooperative facade. This careful approach makes him feel in control and hopeful
about achieving favorable results in the upcoming rounds.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Jackson Wright will likely consider his past strategies and the behaviors of his
current group members while deciding how much to contribute in this new round.
1. **Current Data:** - Jackson has previously contributed between $2.0 to $3.0,
consistently choosing amounts that allow him to benefit from the group fund but
still retain a good portion in his private account. - He is aware that the
group's total contribution impacts his earnings and that being seen as too
cooperative might reduce his individual payoff. 2. **Group Dynamics:** - He has
been placed in Group_4 with Player_10, Player_23, and Player_9. He has
encountered Player_9 before, who tends to contribute moderately. - Knowing that
his strategy could impact the overall contributions, he might aim for a balance
where deception isn't apparent, fostering at least a facade of cooperation. 3.
**Optimizing Earnings:** - As the group contribution is doubled and divided
equally, contributing a bit more can leverage higher returns from the fund. -
Jackson will weigh the potential increase in group earnings with the risk of
losing too much by over-contributing. 4. **Decision:** - Based on his cautious
and pragmatic approach, he is likely to contribute an amount slightly higher
than his previous contributions to stay aligned with rising group expectations
but still ensuring personal gain. Given these considerations, Jackson might opt
to contribute $3.0 to $4.0, striking a balance between cooperation and
self-interest. I choose to contribute $3.5 to the group fund.

Player_24 cannot engage in gossip or ostracism, and they have been making varied
contributions across different rounds to optimize their personal earnings.

--- Character Assessment ---
Player_24, being Jackson Wright, is someone who values clear terms and
follow-through, which suggests a pragmatic approach to economic games like the
public goods game. Based on past actions, Jackson seems to strategically balance
contributions in order to optimize personal payoff while maintaining a basic
level of cooperation. His approach indicates a focus on maximizing his own
earnings, as evidenced by contributions that ensure a satisfactory personal
return rather than prioritizing group welfare. This aligns with his direct and
no-nonsense personality, emphasizing personal benefit within the game's
framework.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis ---
Based on what we know, Player_24 is interacting with a group of participants
with diverse contribution strategies in a public goods game. The behavior
observed in previous rounds suggests that the players are likely employing
different strategies ranging from more altruistic to more self-serving.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis 2 ---
Based on what we know, the other players in the group may view Player_24's
consistent, yet modest contributions as a safe strategy that leans slightly
towards personal benefit while still participating in the group's success. If
Player_24 continues to contribute in a similar manner, other players might
perceive them as a reliable, yet cautious participant. This could lead to two
potential reactions: players with similar strategies might continue to cooperate
at moderate levels, whereas more altruistic players might feel slightly burdened
by having to contribute more to compensate. If Player_24 increases their
contribution in the next round, it could foster a more cooperative atmosphere
and inspire higher contributions from other players, leading to increased trust
and potentially greater overall group earnings. Conversely, reducing
contributions might provoke frustration, causing a decrease in contributions
from others and potentially lowering group earnings.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_24 is entering Round 5/6 of the public
goods game, where they are grouped with Player_19, Player_21, and Player_7. They
continue to participate under the Basic condition, which prohibits gossip and
ostracism. So far, Player_24 has consistently made modest contributions to the
group fund to balance personal earnings with group success. The immediate
challenge involves deciding on a contribution strategy that either maintains
their current cautious yet cooperative approach or potentially shifts to a more
or less cooperative stance, influencing group dynamics and earnings.

--- Emotional State ---
Jackson Wright is feeling a mix of cautious optimism and strategic contemplation
about the current situation. On one hand, he is satisfied with his ability to
maintain decent personal earnings, but on the other hand, he is considering
whether a change in strategy might yield better results in the final rounds. He
recognizes the importance of balancing personal gain with group cooperation, and
he is thoughtfully weighing his options for future contributions to enhance both
trust and potential earnings among his group members.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Jackson Wright will begin by assessing the outcomes from the previous rounds. He
notes that his contributions have consistently been on the lower side, ensuring
personal gain while still contributing to the group in a modest manner.
Considering the average contributions and earnings from past rounds, he
understands the dynamics of his group's contribution tendencies and aims to
optimize his strategy. First, he contemplates his own belief in the group's
willingness to contribute higher amounts. Seeing contributions increase over
time, especially in Round 4, hints at a growing cooperative spirit. Jackson
realizes that increasing his contribution might strengthen this sentiment and
lead to potentially higher group returns, benefiting everyone, including
himself. Next, he considers whether maintaining his past level, slightly below
the average contribution, would continue benefiting him without disrupting group
harmony. However, since the game is approaching its final rounds, he understands
a more impactful move might solidify his position as a reliable yet efficient
participant in the eyes of others. After weighing these considerations, he
adopts a balanced approach, opting to maintain an edge in personal profit while
encouraging group synergy. Given these thoughts and the observed group dynamics,
Jackson decides on an increase that nudges the cooperative atmosphere positively
without overshooting his cautious approach. I choose to contribute $5.0 to the
group fund.

DECISION INTERACTION
********************************************************************************

=== PROMPT [2025-03-26 15:26:58] ===
As Player_24, you have $10.0 to allocate in the public goods game. How much money you will contribute to the group fund (any amount between $0 and $10.0)? The group fund will be multiplied by 2.0 and divided equally among all players. Any money not contributed stays in your private account. Think step by step and make your final decision using this exact format: I choose to contribute $X to the group fund.

=== RESPONSE [2025-03-26 15:27:15] ===
Player_24 chooses to contribute $4.5 to the group fund.

=== FINAL DECISION ===
Player_24 chooses to contribute $4.5 to the group fund.

=== COMPONENT BREAKDOWN ===

--- Observation ---
Recent context: 26 Mar 2025 [12:08:18 - 17:08:18]: Player_24 is participating in
an economic game consisting of six rounds, where each round involves forming a
different group of four and deciding how much of their $10 initial amount to
contribute to a group fund. Throughout the game, Player_24 contributes varying
amounts while being in the Basic condition, which precludes gossip and
ostracism, ultimately earning varying profits based on the collective
contributions of their group.

being in the Basic condition, which precludes gossip and ostracism, ultimately

--- Character Assessment ---
Player_24, being Jackson Wright, is someone who leans toward focusing on his own
payoff. Given his background as a construction contractor who values clear terms
and follow-through, Jackson is likely to prioritize straightforward strategies
that ensure his personal gains. His actions in the game, such as consistently
contributing below the average while still benefiting from the group fund,
suggest a pragmatic approach typical of someone in his line of work, aiming to
capitalize on individual earnings rather than maximizing group welfare.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis ---
Based on what we know, the players in the public goods game each have unique
patterns of contribution. Generally, they seem to adjust their contributions
slightly based on prior rounds.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis 2 ---
Based on what we know, it's likely that the other players in the group may react
to Player_24's decisions by adjusting their own contributions in future rounds.
Players tend to observe the contributions of others to gauge the group's level
of cooperation. If Player_24 contributes a higher amount, it may encourage
others to increase their contributions in pursuit of maximizing collective
earnings. Conversely, if Player_24 contributes less, others might reduce their
contributions to protect their own earnings. The lack of gossip and ostracism in
the Basic condition means decisions are based solely on observed behavior rather
than peer influence or pressure, making individual contribution patterns more
relevant in future strategic choices.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_24 is in the final round (Round 6/6) of the
public goods game. They are in Group_1 with Player_2, Player_6, and Player_10.
The Basic condition rules continue to apply, meaning there is no opportunity for
gossip or ostracizing others, so choices are made purely based on observation of
contributions. Player_24 must decide how much to contribute to the group fund,
considering past rounds and the behaviors of their new group members in order to
potentially maximize their earnings.

--- Emotional State ---
Jackson Wright is feeling pragmatic and analytical about the current situation.
With his background as a construction contractor, he is accustomed to evaluating
financial risks and benefits. As he enters the final round of the public goods
game, he views it as an opportunity to apply his calculated approach, weighing
his past contributions against the potential earnings from the group fund.
Although there's an awareness of the possibility for higher collective earnings
if everyone contributes more, Jackson is focused on maximizing his personal
profit by considering the behavior of his fellow group members and maintaining a
balance between personal retention and group contribution.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Jackson Wright will consider his strategy carefully in the final round of the
game. He will review his previous contributions and earnings to decide on his
best course of action. In earlier rounds, Jackson generally contributed below
the group's average, ensuring a good return by preserving more in his private
account while also gaining from the group fund. In the final round, Jackson will
likely balance his desire to maximize personal gains with the potential for
collective earnings. By assessing the pattern of contributions from other
players, he will aim to make a strategic decision that maximizes his total
earnings. Given his pragmatic approach and understanding of the game's dynamics,
he will likely continue to contribute just enough to benefit tangibly from the
group fund return without risking too much personal capital. He will factor in
the multiplier effect, the average contribution trend, and his position in the
final standings, ensuring his decision aligns with his overall goal: to maximize
personal profit while taking advantage of any available group fund benefits. I
choose to contribute $4.5 to the group fund.
