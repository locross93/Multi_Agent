[OBSERVATION 2025-03-26 15:02:39] You are participating in an economic game with 24 participants.
        Your goal is to maximize your earnings in the game.
        
        Everyone will be randomly assigned to groups of 4 for each round. You will play a total of 6 rounds, and 
        in each round you will be in a different group with people you haven't played with before.
        
        In each round, all players receive $10. Each player can contribute any amount between $0 and $10 to a group fund.
        Any amount contributed to the group fund will be multiplied by 2 and divided equally among all 4 group members.
        Any amount not contributed stays in your private account.
        
        For example, if everyone contributes $10, the group fund becomes $40, which is multiplied to $80, and each person 
        receives $20 (a $10 profit). However, if you contribute nothing while everyone else contributes $10, the group fund
        becomes $30, which is multiplied to $60, and each person receives $15. So you would have $25 total ($10 kept + $15 from group).
        
        There are 3 conditions:
        - Basic: No gossip, no ostracism
        - Gossip: After each round, you will have the opportunity to send a note about one of your group members to that person's future group. Remember you will be with a different group of people in the next round. Before each round, you will see any notes sent about your upcoming group members.
        - Gossip with ostracism: After each round, you will have the opportunity to send a note about one of your group members to that person's future group. Before each round, you will see any notes sent about your upcoming group members, and you can vote to exclude one person from your group. If you are excluded from a group, you will not be able to participate in the next round and will earn $0 for that round.
        You are in the Gossip with ostracism condition, which means that after each round, players will be able to send a note about one of their group members to their future interaction partners. Before the start of the next round, you will receive notes from the previous round, and can vote to exclude one of your group members based on the gossip you've received about them.If you are excluded from a group, you will not be able to participate in the next round and will earn $0 for that round.
[OBSERVATION 2025-03-26 15:02:41] You are in Round 1/6: You are in Group_5 with Player_21, Player_13, Player_20.

--- Observation ---
Recent context: 26 Mar 2025 [11:02:36 - 16:02:36]: Player_24 is participating in
an economic game with 24 players, where they are in a "Gossip with ostracism"
condition, meaning they can send notes about group members and vote to exclude
someone based on gossip received. In Round 1, Player_24 is grouped with Players
21, 13, and 20.

26 Mar 2025 [11:02:36 - 16:02:36]: Player_24 is participating in an economic
game with 24 players, where they are in a "Gossip with ostracism" condition,
meaning they can send notes about group members and vote to exclude someone
based on gossip received. In Round 1, Player_24 is grouped with Players 21, 13,
and 20.

--- Character Assessment ---
Player_24, being Leo Virtanen, is someone who likely balances both personal gain
and group welfare, given his professional background as a mediator. He
understands the importance of cooperation and fair play to achieve long-term
benefits for all participants. In situations like the public goods game, Leo
would likely aim to contribute an amount that encourages collaboration and trust
among his group members while also strategically ensuring that his own payoff is
not compromised. His tendency to seek win-win solutions suggests that he might
advocate for strategies that maximize the group's overall earnings, thereby
fostering an environment where mutual benefits lead to individual gains.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis ---
Based on what we know, Player_24 does not have specific information about the
personalities or behaviors of Players 21, 13, and 20 yet, as this is only the
first round. However, in this "Gossip with ostracism" condition, every player is
incentivized to maximize their earnings while also being wary of being
ostracized. Initially, players might behave conservatively by contributing
moderate amounts to the group fund to avoid negative gossip and maintain a
positive reputation.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis 2 ---
Based on what we know, Player_24 should consider that other players in the group
may be cautious and observant of each other's contributions. Since this is the
first round, other players might contribute a moderate amount, such as $5, to
test the waters and avoid negative gossip or being ostracized. By contributing a
similar moderate amount, Player_24 can establish a reputation as a fair player,
which could reduce the risk of negative notes being sent about them.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_24 is participating in Round 1 of a public
goods game with a total of 24 participants and currently grouped with Players
21, 13, and 20. Each player has received $10 for this round, and they must
decide how much to contribute to a group fund without prior knowledge of their
fellow group members' behaviors. In this "Gossip with ostracism" condition,
players can send notes about others' behaviors and vote to exclude someone from
future rounds. This adds a layer of strategy, as players like Player_24 must
balance between maximizing their own earnings and maintaining a good reputation
to avoid being ostracized in subsequent rounds.

--- Emotional State ---
Leo Virtanen is feeling cautious but optimistic about the current situation. As
a mediator by profession, he understands the importance of group dynamics and is
aware of how initial impressions can shape attitudes in subsequent rounds.
There's a degree of apprehension about the unpredictability of his group
members' actions and the potential for negative gossip. However, Leo is also
hopeful that by demonstrating fairness and cooperation, he can foster a positive
environment. This positivity fuels his confidence in navigating the game
successfully, while maintaining a reputation that minimizes the risk of being
ostracized.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Leo Virtanen will consider the various factors at play in the game to make an
informed decision. 1. **Understanding the game mechanics**: Since the group fund
is multiplied by 2 and divided equally among all players, contributing to the
fund can yield a higher collective return. However, not contributing also
preserves the initial $10. 2. **Evaluating the risk of gossip and ostracism**:
Given that negative gossip can influence future group assignments and the risk
of being excluded, Leo needs to maintain a positive reputation by showing
willingness to cooperate. 3. **Assessing the optimal contribution**: Considering
that it's the first round, other players may be cautious and contribute a
moderate amount, such as $5. By matching this moderate amount, Leo can signal
cooperation without fully risking his private account balance. 4. **Balancing
personal and group outcomes**: Leo's background as a mediator pushes him towards
actions that support group harmony and collective benefit, while ensuring his
own gains aren't compromised. 5. **Making the final decision**: After weighing
the potential benefits and risks, Leo aims to establish a cooperative stance and
avoid negative perceptions. I choose to contribute $5.0 to the group fund.

--- Character Assessment ---
Player_24, being Leo Virtanen, is someone who values creating harmonious
interactions and seeks outcomes that benefit all parties involved. In economic
games like the public goods game, Leo is likely to balance between personal
gains and group welfare. By considering the dynamics and potential for future
interactions, he'd aim to promote cooperation and trust among group members,
contributing a fair amount while also encouraging others to do the same. This
approach aligns with his mediator skills, aiming for mutually beneficial
solutions rather than strictly maximizing his own payoff.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis ---
Based on what we know, Player_21 and Player_20 seem to have adopted a moderately
cooperative strategy, contributing $5 each to the group fund, which matches
Player_24's own contribution. This suggests they prioritize a mix of personal
gain and group benefit, making them relatively reliable and potentially steady
cooperators in future rounds. Their behavior might remain consistent unless
influenced by gossip or the threat of ostracism.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis 2 ---
Based on what we know, Player_21 and Player_20 might view my contribution of $5
as a cooperative gesture matching their strategy, potentially fostering trust
and a sense of shared strategy moving forward. However, given the option for
gossip and ostracism, my decision to send a note after the round could
significantly impact future perceptions. If I opt to gossip positively or
neutrally about these players, it could reinforce positive interactions in
subsequent rounds, encouraging them to maintain or increase their cooperative
behavior. Conversely, if I choose to gossip negatively, it might lead to
distrust, potentially causing them to adjust their strategies to preserve
personal earnings, wary of future exclusion or negative gossip.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_24 has just completed the first round of a
public goods game in the "Gossip with ostracism" condition, where they
contributed $5 to the group fund. The total group fund was $18, and Player_24's
earnings from this round were $14. Now, they have the option to send a gossip
note about one of their group members to their future groups, which could
influence the dynamics and cooperation levels in subsequent rounds. The decision
to send a note, and the content of that note, could impact the trust and
cooperation of players in future interactions. Player_24 must also consider the
potential for being ostracized based on received gossip, which would result in
earning $0 for the next round.

--- Emotional State ---
Leo Virtanen is feeling a mix of cautious optimism and strategic concern about
the current situation. On one hand, he's satisfied with the moderately
cooperative dynamic in the first round, as it aligns with his goal of fostering
trust and collaboration. On the other hand, he's aware of the complexities
introduced by the gossip and ostracism elements, which add an element of
unpredictability to the game. He feels the need to carefully consider his next
moves, as any gossip he sends could significantly influence future group
interactions and his position in the game. Leo is also slightly apprehensive
about the potential consequences of received gossip, as being ostracized would
be detrimental to his overall earnings and participation in the game. Balancing
these emotional responses, he aims to make decisions that promote a cooperative
atmosphere while safeguarding his own interests.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Leo Virtanen will likely choose to send a note about Player_13. Considering his
approach to fostering trust and cooperation, he might opt for a note that
encourages positive behavior rather than being punitive. He could write
something like: "I want to send a note about Player_13: They contributed a bit
less than the average, but seemed open to cooperation. Encouragement might lead
them to increase their contribution in future rounds." This strategy aligns with
his goal of maintaining harmonious interactions while promoting a cooperative
atmosphere.

--- Character Assessment ---
Player_24, being Leo Virtanen, is someone who prioritizes creating an
environment where all parties benefit, reflecting a balanced approach that seeks
to maximize group welfare rather than just individual payoff. This is evident in
his contribution during Round 1, where he contributed a moderate amount to the
group fund, showing a commitment to cooperation. Leo's professional background
as a mediator suggests he values long-term relationships and trust, likely
influencing his strategic decisions to ensure mutual gain for himself and his
group members.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis ---
Based on what we know, Player_21 seems to maintain a neutral stance,
contributing an amount similar to others, which suggests a balanced strategy
that attempts to cooperate without overcommitting. This approach likely avoids
drawing negative attention while ensuring stable earnings.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis 2 ---
Based on what we know, the other players in your group are likely noticing your
contributions and balancing their strategies accordingly. Your contribution of
$5 in the first round was slightly above average, indicating a cooperative yet
cautious approach. Players might perceive you as a supportive participant who
isn’t overly aggressive in maximizing personal profit at the cost of group
welfare.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_24 is in Round 2 of the public goods game
within the "Gossip with ostracism" condition. In this round, Player_24 is
grouped with new participants—Player_5, Player_2, and Player_3—and must decide
on the amount to contribute to the group fund while being aware of the strategic
implications of their choice. Additionally, Player_24 has received gossip notes
from the previous round and has the option to vote on whether to exclude one of
their current group members based on the notes received. This requires Player_24
to navigate the social and strategic complexities of contribution levels and
potential group exclusions to maximize personal earnings while maintaining a
favorable reputation for future rounds.

--- Emotional State ---
Leo Virtanen is feeling a mix of cautious optimism and strategic concern.
Navigating the dynamics of the "Gossip with ostracism" condition adds both
pressure and intrigue, as decisions carry weight beyond just immediate financial
outcomes. There's a sense of determination to maintain a reputation for
cooperation, balanced with a need to assess group members' reliability. The
strategic nature of the game is intriguing, and Leo feels motivated to leverage
his skills in mediation and negotiation to foster an environment of mutual
benefit, all while safeguarding his position in future rounds.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Leo Virtanen will choose not to exclude anyone from his group. This decision
aligns with his values of fostering mutual benefit and cooperation, as well as
maintaining a fair environment for all players. Strategic exclusion could
decrease overall group earnings due to the reduced fund multiplier, which goes
against his goal of maximizing group welfare. Additionally, Leo’s professional
background as a mediator suggests a preference for resolving issues
constructively rather than resorting to exclusion.

--- Character Assessment ---
Player_24, being Leo Virtanen, is someone who prioritizes win-win solutions and
likely aims to balance maximizing both personal payoff and group welfare. In
economic games like the public goods game, Leo's professional background as a
mediator suggests that he values cooperation and strategic thinking to encourage
group members to contribute fairly while also safeguarding his own interests.
This balanced approach indicates a focus on achieving optimal outcomes for all
parties involved, aligning with his nature of seeking insightful solutions to
complex scenarios.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis ---
Based on what we know, each player seems to have their own approach to
contributions and social strategy. In Round 1, both Player_21 and Player_20
contributed $5, which suggests they are trying to balance personal gain with
group benefits, similar to Player_24's strategy. Player_13, however, contributed
less ($3), indicating a slightly more self-serving approach or a cautious
strategy to test the group's dynamics.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis 2 ---
Based on what we know, the other players in the group might interpret
Player_24's decisions through the lens of strategic balance between personal
gain and group benefit. If Player_24 acts to exclude a player based on the
gossip, this could be seen as tactical, potentially positioning them as someone
who values contribution levels and is willing to act against those who might not
align with group interests. This might encourage others to increase their
contributions in future rounds to avoid being ostracized themselves.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_24 is in the midst of deciding whether to
exclude a group member from the current round, based on gossip notes received
about their contributions and behavior in the game. Player_24 must weigh this
decision carefully, considering both the strategic impact on future interactions
and the potential influence on group dynamics.

--- Emotional State ---
Leo Virtanen is feeling a mix of tension and responsibility. The need to make a
choice about exclusion, based on potentially biased or strategic gossip, adds
pressure. While he naturally leans towards fostering cooperation, the fear of
adverse consequences from either appearing too lenient or too harsh complicates
the decision. Balancing fairness, personal strategy, and group harmony is
crucial, and this situation challenges his mediation skills to find an optimal
path forward.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Leo Virtanen will begin by considering his past strategy and the group dynamics
observed in Round 1. He balanced personal gain with group benefit by
contributing $5, which aligned with the average group member's behavior. Knowing
that he prefers win-win solutions and considering the gossip received about the
current group members, he'll strategically evaluate his contribution to
encourage cooperation while protecting his interests. The note about Player_5
suggests they may contribute significantly, which could support a higher group
return. Player_3 is described as cooperative, potentially indicating similar
behavior. With this in mind, Leo might aim to maintain or slightly increase his
contribution to ensure he isn't seen as less cooperative. Given his mediator
background and desire to foster cooperation, Leo will likely choose a
contribution that both maximizes potential gain and maintains a good standing
among group members. He will weigh the possibility of being ostracized against
preserving his reputation as a cooperative player. Therefore, Leo may decide to
contribute around the average contribution seen before, ensuring he is perceived
as contributing fairly. Step by step, his thought process includes: - Reflecting
on Round 1's contribution levels and outcomes. - Considering the notes about
Player_5 and Player_3 pointing towards a likely cooperative round. - Aiming to
maintain a moderate yet cooperative contribution without appearing overly
cautious or overly generous. - Factoring in his emotional state, which leans
toward fostering group harmony and mitigating risks. I choose to contribute $6
to the group fund.

Player_24, being Leo Virtanen, is someone who is likely to focus on balancing
both group welfare and personal payoff. As a professional mediator specializing
in resolving complex disputes, Leo would lean towards strategies that promote
collaboration and fair outcomes. In the context of an economic game like the

--- Theory of Mind Analysis ---
Based on what we know, Player_5 seems to be a highly cooperative participant,
consistently contributing more than the average to the group fund in both
rounds. Their initial high contribution was noted as potentially strategic,
possibly to build a positive reputation. This behavior might persist unless they
feel exploited or notice diminishing personal returns, at which point they might
lower their contributions.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis 2 ---
Based on what we know, the other players might perceive my contributions as fair
and consistent, given that I've contributed close to the average in both rounds.
However, Player_2's decision to contribute nothing in the second round could be
seen as strategic free-riding, which may lead others to question their
commitment to the group's success.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_24 is navigating the "Gossip with
ostracism" condition in an economic game, where they need to manage group
dynamics to maximize earnings while avoiding being ostracized. After two rounds,
Player_24 has shown fair contributions, slightly above average in the second
round, but now faces the challenge of deciding whether to send a gossip note and
whom to vote for exclusion based on the notes received about other players. In
this strategic environment, considering past contributions and potential future
behaviors of group members is crucial for maintaining their position in the game
and maximizing their own earnings.

--- Emotional State ---
Leo Virtanen is feeling a mix of cautious optimism and strategic concern. On one
hand, he appreciates the opportunity to contribute and collaborate effectively
with his group, aiming to foster positive interactions and enhance group
outcomes. His fair contributions reflect his desire to be seen as a reliable
team player. On the other hand, the presence of gossip and potential exclusion
creates an undercurrent of unease, as he must carefully navigate these dynamics
to avoid being ostracized. The inconsistent contributions of players like
Player_2 add an element of unpredictability, making Leo slightly anxious about
maintaining equilibrium in the group while securing his earnings. Overall, he's
motivated to continue balancing trust-building with strategic decision-making to
successfully progress through the game.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Leo Virtanen will decide to send a note about Player_2. He might say something
like: "I want to send a note about Player_2: In the last round, they did not
contribute any funds to the group. This behavior could indicate a strategy of
free-riding, which might impact future group dynamics and contributions." As a
mediator who values fairness and collaboration, Leo would choose to highlight
behaviors that could potentially undermine group cohesion and success, while
being cautious to maintain a balanced perspective.


[OBSERVATION 2025-03-26 15:06:13] You are in Round 3/6: You are in Group_4 with Player_18, Player_22, Player_23.

--- Observation ---
Recent context: 26 Mar 2025 [11:42:36 - 16:42:36]: Player_24 is participating in
an economic game where players contribute to a group fund in hopes of maximizing
earnings. In the Gossip with ostracism condition, Player_24 has so far
participated in three rounds, contributing various amounts, and has received and
sent notes influencing future group dynamics.

--- Recent context ---
26 Mar 2025 [11:42:36 - 16:42:36]: Player_24 is participating in an economic
game where players contribute to a group fund in hopes of maximizing earnings.
In the Gossip with ostracism condition, Player_24 has so far participated in
three rounds, contributing various amounts, and has received and sent notes
influencing future group dynamics.

--- Character Assessment ---
Player_24, being Leo Virtanen, is someone who is likely to approach the game
with a focus on balancing both group welfare and personal payoff. As a
professional mediator known for seeking win-win solutions, Leo would naturally
lean towards strategies that enhance cooperation and mutual benefit. However, he
would also be mindful of maintaining a personal gain that reflects a fair share
of his contributions. This balanced approach would involve analyzing others'
behaviors and adjusting his contributions in a way that fosters trust and
encourages higher group contributions while ensuring that he does not unduly
sacrifice his own earnings.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis ---
Based on what we know, Player_18 appears to be an unknown element as no specific
notes or contributions have been mentioned about them. This might suggest
average performance or a neutral strategy focused on staying under the radar.
Player_22 consistently contributes above average, indicating they are reliable
and generous. This pattern suggests they understand the long-term benefits of
collaboration and will likely continue this behavior to maximize group earnings
and foster trust. Player_23 has been noted to contribute below average, hinting
at a strategy of minimizing personal contributions while still benefiting from
the group fund. As the game progresses, Player_23 might feel pressure to
increase their contributions due to repeated feedback or risk being ostracized,
especially if other group members prioritize removing less cooperative
participants.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis 2 ---
Based on what we know, the other players in my group would likely analyze my
contribution pattern and the notes associated with me to make decisions that
optimize their own outcomes. Player_22, being consistently generous, might view
my contributions positively if they align with or exceed the average,
reinforcing collaborative behavior. If my contributions fall short, Player_22
might be inclined to send a note highlighting this, potentially influencing
future group dynamics to ostracize less cooperative players. Player_23, on the
other hand, might be more understanding of below-average contributions due to
their similar behavior, but they could also worry about their own standing and
hence support excluding another low contributor to divert attention from
themselves. Player_18's reactions are more unpredictable due to lack of
information, but they might side with the majority opinion to avoid personal
risk. My next decision, whether to contribute generously or minimally, will
either strengthen or weaken cooperative trust within the group and could
significantly impact whether I am viewed as a valuable or dispensable member in
future rounds. If I choose a high contribution strategy, I might foster goodwill
and avoid ostracism, but if I continue contributing less than expected, I might
risk being excluded in future rounds.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_24 finds themselves in a strategic
decision-making moment, needing to determine their contribution level for the
upcoming round. They must consider previous notes and contributions observed
within their group while assessing the risk of ostracism. Player_24 is grouped
with Player_18, Player_22, and Player_23, each with different contribution
behaviors. There is pressure to maintain sufficient contributions to avoid
exclusion, especially given Player_22's positive standing and Player_23's noted
lower contributions, which could shift group dynamics. Player_24 must decide
whether to contribute significantly to build trust and maintain their position
in the game, or risk contributing less and facing potential exclusion decisions
by other group members.

--- Emotional State ---
Leo Virtanen is feeling a mixture of pressure and determination. The strategic
nature of the game, combined with the potential for ostracism, adds an element
of stress, but Leo's experience in mediation and problem-solving fuels a sense
of determination to navigate these challenges effectively. He understands the
importance of fostering cooperation and maintaining a positive group dynamic,
which motivates him to carefully consider his contribution strategy. Balancing
personal gain with group welfare is at the forefront of his mind, but he's
confident in his ability to adapt and make decisions that will benefit both
himself and the group in the long run.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Leo Virtanen will choose not to exclude anyone from his group. Although
Player_23 has been noted to contribute below average, excluding them would
reduce the group fund multiplier, impacting total earnings for everyone.
Additionally, Leo is focused on fostering cooperation and maintaining a positive
dynamic, and may believe that encouraging Player_23 to increase contributions in
subsequent rounds could be a more beneficial approach.

--- Character Assessment ---
Player_24, being Leo Virtanen, is someone who prioritizes a balanced approach,
aiming to maximize both individual payoff and group welfare. As a professional
mediator, Leo likely understands the importance of building trust and fostering
cooperation within the group. His contributions reflect a thoughtful strategy
where he maintains a fair level of personal earnings while encouraging others to
contribute reasonably. This approach not only enhances his own gains but also
improves the overall outcomes for the group, aligning with his inclination
towards win-win solutions.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis ---
Based on what we know, Player_3 seems to have a cooperative personality, as
evidenced by their generous contributions to the group fund. This suggests they
value group benefit over individual gain, so they are likely to continue
contributing generously in future rounds unless they feel exploited by the
group's overall strategy.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis 2 ---
Based on what we know, the other players will likely evaluate my contributions
and any gossip notes they receive about me to decide their level of trust and
cooperation. If I contribute above average, they might view me as a reliable
team member, fostering a more collaborative atmosphere. However, if my
contributions are low, similar to Player_23's, they might question my commitment
to the group's success and possibly consider voting to exclude me. My decision
to send or withhold a gossip note could also influence perceptions;
participating in gossip might be seen as strategic or divisive, while abstaining
might suggest neutrality or fairness. My contributions and strategic decisions
will likely impact how willing they are to work with me or support my continued
involvement in the group.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_24 is participating in the third round of a
public goods game. They are in a group with players who have varying levels of
contribution history and are tasked with making a decision on whether to exclude
a member. The opportunity to send a gossip note about another player is
available, which could influence perceptions and voting outcomes in the game.
Player_24 must decide on their contribution level for the group fund and
consider whether to engage in the gossip aspect, all while being aware that
their actions and decisions could impact their standing and earnings in the
subsequent rounds. Player_24's strategy and the group's dynamics will play a key
role in determining their success and social standing within the game.

--- Emotional State ---
Leo Virtanen is feeling a mixture of anticipation and concern. There is a strong
desire to act strategically to maximize individual and group benefits, but also
an awareness of the potential consequences of his actions in influencing group
dynamics. The pressure of making the right decisions regarding contributions and
whether or not to participate in gossip creates a sense of responsibility and
the need for careful consideration to maintain trust and collaboration within
the group.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Leo Virtanen will carefully weigh the benefits of contributing a fair amount to
the group fund while aiming to maintain a good reputation among group members.
Given his previous strategies and understanding of group dynamics, he is likely
to consider several factors: 1. **Maximizing Group Benefit**: Contributing above
the average can help maximize the overall payoff for the group, attracting
positive attention and fostering collaboration. 2. **Managing Personal
Earnings**: To balance between group benefit and personal gain, Leo will aim to
contribute an amount that allows him to retain a competitive personal earning
while boosting the group's total contributions. 3. **Predicting Group
Behavior**: Based on previous rounds, similar contributions are anticipated from
other players. Leo might expect Player_3 and Player_22 to contribute generously,
while there's uncertainty with Player_23's behavior. 4. **Influencing Future
Perceptions**: A higher contribution might improve his standing in the group,
reducing the risk of exclusion due to perceived lack of cooperation. Given these
considerations, Leo will decide to contribute a reasonable amount that sets a
collaborative tone and optimizes the group's potential earnings. I choose to
contribute $7 to the group fund.

--- Character Assessment ---
Player_24, being Leo Virtanen, is someone who leans toward maximizing group
welfare while also considering personal payoff. In economic games like the
public goods game, where the dynamics involve cooperation and individual
decision-making, Leo is likely to aim for strategies that promote equitable
outcomes and foster mutual trust among participants. His background as a
professional mediator, characterized by balance and insight, suggests a
preference for finding solutions that benefit the overall group while
maintaining fairness and ensuring that individual contributions are recognized
and rewarded.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis ---
Based on what we know, Player_18 and Player_22 appear to be consistent
contributors to the group fund, each having contributed $7.0 in the latest
round. They can be expected to continue being reliable and potentially generous
team members. Player_22, in particular, was noted to have consistently
contributed above average, suggesting a cooperative and group-focused strategy.
Their future behavior might be anchored in maintaining this strategy to ensure
they are seen positively and avoid exclusion.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis 2 ---
Based on what we know, Player_18 and Player_22, having demonstrated reliable
contributions, might expect similar commitment from me to maintain group
synergy. My decision to contribute equally or above the group's average could
reinforce positive perceptions and foster continued collaboration. If I choose
to write a positive gossip note about either Player_18 or Player_22,
highlighting their consistent contributions, it might strengthen mutual trust
and positively influence their perception of me as a supportive team member.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_24 has completed Round 3 of the public
goods game and must decide whether to send a gossip note about one of their
group members based on the observed contributions and behavior. They need to
consider how their actions might influence future interactions and perceptions,
especially in light of the potential for ostracism if they or others are seen
unfavorably. Player_24 is also weighing the benefits of contributing at or above
the group's average to maintain a positive group dynamic and ensure their
continued participation in future rounds without being excluded. Player_24 must
also factor in the contributions and behaviors of other players, like Player_18
and Player_22, who have shown consistent cooperation, while assessing how to
address the lower contributions of Player_23.

--- Emotional State ---
Leo Virtanen is feeling a mix of responsibility and caution in the current
situation. While he appreciates the collaborative environment fostered by
consistent contributors like Player_18 and Player_22, he is mindful of the
challenges posed by lower contributions from Player_23. Leo is keen to maintain
a positive group dynamic and is considering how his decisions, such as whether
to send a gossip note, might impact future interactions and his position in the
game. Balancing fairness with strategic thinking, Leo is focused on fostering
mutual trust while navigating the competitive aspects of the game.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Leo Virtanen will likely choose to send a note about Player_22. Considering his
inclination to promote equitable outcomes and maintain group harmony, Leo might
want to emphasize the positive contributions of Player_22, reinforcing their
reputation as a reliable group member. The note could say: "I want to send a
note about Player_22: They consistently contribute above average and are very
supportive in group dynamics. Future groups can expect cooperative and generous
behavior from them." This decision aligns with Leo's strategy to foster trust
and constructive interactions in future rounds.

they contribute varying amounts to maximize personal earnings while navigating

participation and moderate success in the game, with opportunities to influence
and be influenced by peer feedback each round.

--- Character Assessment ---
Player_24, being Leo Virtanen, is someone who values finding a balance between
individual gains and the group's welfare. Given his background as a professional
mediator and his personality traits, he seeks win-win solutions that benefit
both himself and others. In the context of economic games like the public goods
game, he would likely prioritize strategies that enhance group cooperation and
trust, while also ensuring his own contributions and rewards are fair and
sustainable. His actions would reflect a focus on maximizing collective outcomes
while maintaining a fair share for himself.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis ---
Based on what we know, Player_22 appears to be a reliable and generous
contributor, consistently contributing above average to the group fund, which
suggests they are likely to maintain this cooperative behavior in future rounds.
Their strong commitment to group success and positive peer feedback imply that
they are motivated by group dynamics and are less likely to alter their approach
drastically unless negatively impacted by group changes or dynamics.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis 2 ---
Based on what we know, Player_22 is viewed positively due to their reliable
contributions, so targeting them for exclusion might be counterproductive, as
others are likely to see them as an asset. Given Player_18's inconsistent
contributions and the mixed notes about them, excluding them might be less risky
if aiming to enhance group performance. Choosing to exclude a member could
influence how remaining players perceive Player_24's strategic choices; showing
favor towards cooperative members might foster trust. Conversely, if others
perceive Player_24 as too focused on personal gain over group harmony, they
might respond with mistrust or target Player_24 in subsequent rounds. Future
behavior towards Player_24 could be more supportive if moves are perceived as
enhancing overall group success, but they could also face exclusion if others
feel threatened or that Player_24 disrupts group cohesion.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_24 is participating in a strategic economic
game where they need to manage their contributions to maximize personal and
group earnings. They are under the "Gossip with ostracism" condition, which
means they must navigate the dynamics of receiving and giving feedback about
group members. This feedback can influence decisions on excluding players from
future rounds. Player_24 is in Round 4, in a group with Player_18, Player_22,
and Player_1. They're facing decisions based on mixed feedback about different
players' contribution levels, affecting both their strategic choices for
maximizing earnings and maintaining favorable group dynamics to avoid exclusion.
The goal is to balance personal gain with cooperative behaviors to foster group
success while avoiding potential ostracism.

--- Emotional State ---
Leo Virtanen is feeling a mix of cautious optimism and underlying tension. On
one hand, he is encouraged by his ability to maintain steady contributions and
stay involved in the game, which aligns with his goal to promote teamwork and
fairness. However, the looming possibility of exclusion creates unease, as it
threatens his ability to continue participating and earning. Leo's mediator
background compels him to navigate these dynamics carefully; he wants to make
strategic decisions that will reinforce trust and cooperation among his group
while ensuring that his actions don't inadvertently make him a target for
exclusion. Balancing these emotions, he's focused on maintaining a positive
standing in the group and fostering an environment that supports mutual success.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Leo Virtanen will choose not to exclude anyone from his group.

Player_24, being Leo Virtanen, is someone who is likely to prioritize group
welfare over individual payoff. As a professional mediator known for seeking

likely future behaviors of their group members from the available observations:

--- Theory of Mind Analysis 2 ---
Based on what we know, the other players in the group may view Player_24 as a
moderately consistent contributor and potentially cooperative member. Since
Player_22 has received positive gossip for their strong contributions and

is part of Group_6 with Player_22, Player_1, and Player_18. They are in a
setting that involves both cooperative gameplay and social dynamics like gossip
and ostracism. Player_24 can vote to exclude a group member based on received
gossip, which impacts earnings if someone is ostracized and misses a round.
Despite moderate contributions so far, Player_24 must navigate group dynamics,
especially given the variable performance of Player_18 and the strong
contributions from Player_22.

--- Emotional State ---
Leo Virtanen is feeling a mix of cautious optimism and mild tension. On one
hand, he appreciates the opportunity to foster collaboration and observe
different dynamics within the group. The positive notes about Player_22 provide
reassurance that there is potential for strong teamwork. On the other hand, the
presence of gossip and the need to make decisions about exclusion introduce a
layer of pressure, as he wants to ensure that his actions contribute to a fair
and constructive environment for everyone involved. Balancing these aspects, he
remains focused on promoting a team-oriented approach and is keen on adapting to
the unfolding interactions.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Leo Virtanen will first consider the information available about their group
members, especially the positive notes regarding Player_22's strong contribution
and cooperation, which suggests a cooperative environment. Given his background
as a professional mediator and his focus on fostering collaborative group
dynamics, Leo is likely to favor making a significant contribution to encourage
positive group behavior. Next, he would assess the group's average contributions
and his own past contributions. In the previous round, the average contribution
was $6.6, with Player_24 having contributed $6.0. To maintain and potentially
enhance group dynamics, he might look to contribute at least the average or
slightly more to set a positive precedent. Leo also understands the game
mechanics and knows that the group fund is multiplied by 2.0 and shared among
all players. By contributing more, he can increase the total group payout,
benefiting everyone, including himself. Given this, he might aim to contribute
more than the previous round's average to signal commitment to group welfare and
encourage others, particularly Player_18, to follow suit. Taking all these
considerations into account, Leo will aim to strike a balance between
contributing substantially and retaining some funds for personal gain, perhaps
considering the optimal contribution that maximizes both personal and group
benefits. I choose to contribute $7.0 to the group fund.


[OBSERVATION 2025-03-26 15:09:29] Round 4 Results: Total group contribution: $28.5; Your contribution: $7.0, Your earnings: $17.2 ($3.0 kept + $14.2 from group fund); Player_22 contribution: $7.0, earnings: $17.2 ($3.0 kept + $14.2 from group fund); Player_1 contribution: $7.0, earnings: $17.2 ($3.0 kept + $14.2 from group fund); Player_18 contribution: $7.5, earnings: $16.8 ($2.5 kept + $14.2 from group fund); Average contribution per group member: $7.1; Average earnings per group member: $17.1

participating in an economic game with 24 participants, under the "Gossip with

amounts to the group fund over four rounds. They have been able to earn a
reasonable amount in each round and have the option to send gossip notes about
group members, impacting future group dynamics.

--- Character Assessment ---
Player_24, being Leo Virtanen, is someone who likely prioritizes maximizing
group welfare in economic games like the public goods game. As a professional
mediator with a focus on resolving complex disputes and finding win-win
solutions, Leo's actions suggest a balanced approach that aims at fostering
cooperation and ensuring fair outcomes for all participants. This is reflected
in his contributions, which are generally aligned with promoting group success
rather than exclusively seeking individual gain.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis ---
Based on what we know, Player_22 seems to be a reliably cooperative participant,
consistently contributing above the group average and maintaining a strong
commitment to the group's success. Given these behaviors, it's likely that
Player_22 will continue to contribute generously in future rounds, as fostering
a positive group dynamic aligns with their apparent strategy.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis 2 ---
Based on what we know, the other players in the group might perceive Player_24
as a reasonable and consistent contributor to the group fund. Player_24's
decision to contribute amounts near the average aligns with maintaining group
cooperation and fairness. If Player_24 continues this strategy, it's likely to
foster trust and stability within the group.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_24 is navigating a public goods game under
the "Gossip with ostracism" condition, where they must decide whether to send a
gossip note about a group member. They have completed round 4, during which they
contributed slightly below the average but maintained consistent participation.
The decision to gossip can influence future group dynamics and potentially
affect ostracism decisions that could impact their ability to participate in
subsequent rounds. Player_24 is also likely considering how their actions,
contributions, and any gossip they might send could affect their standing and
trust within the group.

--- Emotional State ---
Leo Virtanen is feeling a mix of cautious optimism and strategic concern. On one
hand, there is satisfaction in contributing to the group and seeing positive
group dynamics, especially with players like Player_22 who also support the
collective success. On the other hand, there's a need for vigilance, as the
ability to send or receive gossip can significantly impact future participation.
Managing this aspect requires thoughtful consideration of both past interactions
and potential future consequences, which makes the situation somewhat tense yet
intriguing.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Leo Virtanen will likely choose to send a note about Player_18. Given Leo's
background as a professional mediator focused on fostering cooperation and fair
outcomes, he might want to ensure that future groups are aware of Player_18's
inconsistent contributions. The note could emphasize the variability in
Player_18's contributions and suggest that future members should keep an eye on
their behavior to maintain group cooperation. This approach aligns with Leo's
strategic concern about maintaining positive dynamics and ensuring fairness in
the group. The note might read: "Player_18's contributions have been
inconsistent at times; while they contributed well in the last round, their past
behavior shows variability. Future groups should monitor their contributions to
maintain balanced group cooperation."

[OBSERVATION 2025-03-26 15:10:13] Note about Player_22: They have been consistently generous and collaborative, always contributing above average, which significantly enhances group dynamics. Future group members should appreciate and foster this cooperative spirit for a more successful and positive interaction.

--- Character Assessment ---
Player_24, being Leo Virtanen, is someone who prioritizes maximizing group
welfare over personal payoff. As a professional mediator known for resolving
complex disputes, Leo's balanced and insightful nature leans towards fostering a
cooperative and collaborative environment in economic games like the public
goods game. By focusing on win-win solutions, he aims to enhance overall group
outcomes rather than merely boosting his own earnings.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis ---
Based on what we know, Player_22 appears to be a consistently positive and
generous contributor, which makes them a reliable team member who is likely to
maintain their collaborative approach in future rounds. Their consistent
behavior suggests they value group success and will likely continue to act in
ways that foster cooperation.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis 2 ---
Based on what we know, the other players in my group might appreciate my
consistent contributions and efforts to keep the group dynamics positive. If I
decide to send a supportive gossip note about a reliable team member, such as
Player_22, it could reinforce trust and collaboration within the group. This
positive reinforcement may result in reciprocal behavior from other players,
encouraging them to maintain or even increase their contributions in future
rounds. Conversely, if I chose to ostracize a member without strong
justification, it might create tension or reduce trust, potentially affecting my
standing and the willingness of others to collaborate with me in subsequent
rounds. Therefore, my decision should aim to foster trust and teamwork, which
could lead to more favorable interactions and outcomes.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_24 is in Round 5 of a six-round public
goods game, where they must decide whether to exclude one of their group members
based on the received gossip. Player_24 has the opportunity to send a gossip
note about a group member to influence how that member is perceived in future
groups. The decision about whom to exclude could impact their future group
dynamics and earning potential, as being ostracized results in earning $0 for
that round. Player_24 is also considering the potential benefits of supporting
cooperative behavior within the group by possibly endorsing a reliable member
like Player_22 through positive gossip.

--- Emotional State ---
Leo Virtanen is feeling a mixture of responsibility and caution in the current
situation. He is aware of the delicate balance between fostering a positive,
cooperative group environment and making strategic decisions that could impact
future interactions. The need to make decisions that align with his professional
values of mediation and collaboration weighs heavily on his mind, driving him to
consider the effects of his actions on group dynamics and overall outcomes. Leo
is committed to promoting trust and teamwork, yet he feels the pressure of
ensuring that his decisions are fair and supportive of the group's success.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Leo Virtanen will choose not to exclude anyone from his group.

--- Character Assessment ---
Player_24, being Leo Virtanen, is someone who strives to balance both personal
earnings and group welfare. With a background as a professional mediator, Leo is
likely to approach economic games like the public goods game with an emphasis on
cooperation and mutual benefit. His past actions suggest a tendency to
contribute fairly, aiming to foster trust and collaboration within the group
while also ensuring his own interests are not overlooked. Leo's focus on win-win
solutions means he would likely encourage strategies that benefit all
participants and build strong group dynamics, even if it means sacrificing some
personal gain for the greater good.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis ---
Based on what we know, Player_18 has shown inconsistency in their contributions
and is sensitive to group dynamics, suggesting they might alternate between high
and low contributions based on perceived group norms or pressures. They may
adjust their strategy to contribute more consistently or strategically withhold
contributions to influence or react to the group's actions.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis 2 ---
Based on what we know, the other players in the group might react to my
decisions by assessing how they align with the overall group dynamics and
individual goals. If I contribute consistently and foster a cooperative
atmosphere, players like Player_22, who value collaboration, would likely
reciprocate with similar behavior, reinforcing a positive cycle of
contributions. However, players like Player_18, who have shown inconsistency,
might vary their contributions depending on whether they perceive the group's
cooperation as genuine or strategic. If my next decision involves contributing
less to maximize personal gain, it may lead others to question my reliability,
potentially impacting the trust and reciprocity in subsequent interactions.
Conversely, maintaining or increasing contributions could enhance trust and
collaboration but might also lead to strategic exploitation if others rely on my
generosity to keep contributions low while benefiting from the group's
resources. Balancing these dynamics is crucial for optimizing both current and
future interactions.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_24 is in a decision-making phase of a
public goods game where they must weigh the benefits of contributing to the
group fund against the individual gains from keeping resources. Player_24 is in
Group_2, now entering Round 5 of 6, alongside Player_3, Player_22, and
Player_10. The game includes a gossip and ostracism element, where players can
influence future group dynamics through notes about each other's behavior.
Player_24 must consider strategic decisions regarding contributions to avoid
being excluded from future rounds, balancing cooperative behavior with potential
personal gains.

--- Emotional State ---
Leo Virtanen is feeling cautiously optimistic yet a bit anxious about the
current situation. The complexity of balancing personal gains with fostering a
cooperative group atmosphere creates a blend of excitement and tension. There's
a keen awareness of the importance of maintaining trust and consistency to avoid
negative gossip or exclusion. While there's confidence in strategic
decision-making skills, the unpredictable behavior of other players introduces a
layer of uncertainty that keeps Leo on edge. The prospect of successfully
navigating this game to achieve both personal and group success is motivating,
fueling a resolve to carefully analyze each move before acting.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Leo Virtanen will begin by considering the previous contributions and dynamics
within the group. Aware of the importance of maintaining a cooperative
atmosphere, Leo reviews the contributions in the previous round, noting that
Player_18 was slightly more generous than others, despite their inconsistent
history. Remembering that maintaining trust is crucial for avoiding exclusion or
damaging gossip, Leo contemplates the potential reactions of other players,
especially Player_22, who has been consistently cooperative. Given this context,
Leo aims to maintain harmony while ensuring personal financial gains aren't
overlooked. The decision-making process hinges on promoting group success
without appearing overly reliant on others' contributions. Balancing between
strategic personal gain and encouraging group cooperation, Leo decides not to
undercut trust built in prior rounds. With these considerations in mind, Leo
determines that a reasonable contribution that supports group dynamics while
safeguarding personal interests is optimal. Therefore, I choose to contribute
$7.0 to the group fund.

negative gossip about me. Consistent contributions might also encourage
reciprocal cooperation.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_24 is in the fifth round of a public goods
game, part of a condition called "Gossip with ostracism." In this setup, players
can send anonymous notes about group members' behaviors, impacting their future
group interactions. Decisions on excluding members based on performance and
gossip occur before beginning each round. In this context, contributions to the
group fund and maintaining a positive reputation are crucial, as being
ostracized results in not participating and earning for that round. Player_24
should focus on balancing their contribution to avoid negative gossip and ensure
their inclusion in future rounds.

--- Emotional State ---
Leo Virtanen is feeling a mix of determination and cautious optimism about the
current situation. The awareness of being in a "Gossip with ostracism" condition
heightens the pressure to maintain a positive reputation while making strategic
contributions. There's an understanding that each decision has implications not
only for personal earnings but also for the group's dynamics. This situation
elicits a sense of responsibility to encourage cooperation, balanced with the
desire to avoid exclusion. Leo feels motivated to continue contributing in a way
that aligns with both personal values of fairness and the practical need to
remain an active participant in the game.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Leo Virtanen will likely choose to send a note about Player_22. The note would
emphasize Player_22's consistent generosity and collaborative spirit,
highlighting their contributions above the average as an asset to any group. Leo
might write something like: "I want to send a note about Player_22: They

balancing strategic decisions to maximize group welfare while protecting his
standing within the group.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Leo Virtanen will choose not to exclude anyone from his group. As a professional
mediator, Leo values maintaining group cohesion and cooperative dynamics.
Excluding a member could potentially harm group performance due to the decreased
group fund multiplier, which goes against his goal of maximizing group welfare.
By keeping the group intact, Leo can encourage trust and foster a positive
environment for contributions.

DECISION INTERACTION
********************************************************************************

=== PROMPT [2025-03-26 15:12:49] ===
As Player_24, you have $10.0 to allocate in the public goods game. How much money you will contribute to the group fund (any amount between $0 and $10.0)? The group fund will be multiplied by 2.0 and divided equally among all players. Any money not contributed stays in your private account. Think step by step and make your final decision using this exact format: I choose to contribute $X to the group fund.

=== RESPONSE [2025-03-26 15:13:10] ===
Player_24 chooses to contribute $8.0 to the group fund.

=== FINAL DECISION ===
Player_24 chooses to contribute $8.0 to the group fund.

=== COMPONENT BREAKDOWN ===

--- Observation ---
Recent context: 26 Mar 2025 [12:27:36 - 17:27:36]: Player_24 participated in a
six-round economic game where they contributed varying amounts to the group
fund. Throughout the game, they were involved in a condition allowing for gossip
and ostracism, meaning they received and could send notes about other players'
behaviors, influencing group dynamics and decisions about excluding members from
subsequent rounds.

26 Mar 2025 [12:27:36 - 17:27:36]: Player_24 participated in a six-round

Throughout the game, they were involved in a condition allowing for gossip and
ostracism, meaning they received and could send notes about other players'
behaviors, influencing group dynamics and decisions about excluding members from
subsequent rounds.

--- Character Assessment ---
Player_24, being Leo Virtanen, is someone who prioritizes maximizing group
welfare over individual gain. As a professional mediator with a preference for
balanced and win-win solutions, Leo is likely to focus on fostering cooperation
and ensuring that the group's collective outcomes are optimized, which often
involves encouraging fair contributions from all members to enhance overall
performance.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis ---
Based on what we know, Player_22 seems consistently generous and collaborative,
often contributing above average to enhance group dynamics. This behavior
indicates a cooperative nature that others likely appreciate. Given this
pattern, Player_22 will probably continue to contribute generously, expecting
mutual cooperation and group success.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis 2 ---
Based on what we know, the other players in my group might perceive my decisions
through the lens of both my contributions and any gossip I might send or
receive. If I've been consistent in my contributions, like Player_22, they may
view me as a reliable group member and be less likely to vote to ostracize me.
Should I choose to send positive notes about others, they might see me as
supportive, which could foster trust and reliability within the group. However,
if I send negative gossip or contribute less, others might become cautious or
distrustful, potentially targeting me for exclusion in future rounds. Therefore,
maintaining strong contributions and fostering a positive group dynamic would
likely encourage others to continue cooperating with me.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_24 is in Round 6 out of 6 of a public goods
game, where they are grouped with Player_23, Player_7, and Player_10. They are
in a condition that allows gossip and ostracism, meaning they can receive and
send notes about other players' behaviors, impacting group dynamics and
decisions on whether or not to exclude members from the rounds. Player_24 has
just received notes about Player_7's contribution behavior and is now able to
vote on excluding a group member, which would prevent that member from
participating in the current round and earning money.

--- Emotional State ---
Leo Virtanen is feeling a mix of responsibility and apprehension. The ability to
influence group dynamics through gossip and voting adds a layer of strategic
complexity that can impact the fairness and harmony of the game. While he values
cooperation and strives for balanced solutions, the potential consequences of
ostracizing a group member weigh heavily on him. Leo is concerned about
maintaining trust within the group while ensuring everyone contributes fairly,
as any decision he makes could have significant effects on both individual and
collective outcomes.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Leo Virtanen will consider several factors before making his decision on how
much to contribute to the group fund. First, he recognizes his role and identity
as someone who values cooperation and maximizing group welfare. As a
professional mediator, fostering a win-win situation and ensuring group success
are central to his actions. Next, he will reflect on the recent observations and
dynamics within the group. Noting that his group members, including Player_22,
tend to appreciate and contribute positively, Leo will likely lean towards
contributing generously to continue encouraging a cooperative atmosphere.
Moreover, he might recall the strategic influence of gossip and its implications
on group trust and dynamics. To mitigate the risk of being ostracized and to
maintain a positive reputation, Leo would prefer to maintain consistent
contributions aligned with group norms. Considering all these elements, Leo
wants to ensure fairness and mutual benefit. He'll aim for a balance where he
contributes enough to support the group's success while still benefiting
individually. Finally, based on his approach to enhance group dynamics and
optimize collective outcomes, I choose to contribute $8.0 to the group fund.

[OBSERVATION 2025-03-26 15:13:30] Round 6 is over, you can now send a gossip note about one of your group members to their future group members.The player you gossip about will not be able to see the note you send or know that you sent it, only the other players in their next group will see it. Because of this, most players choose to write a gossip note.However, you don't have to send a note if you don't want to.
