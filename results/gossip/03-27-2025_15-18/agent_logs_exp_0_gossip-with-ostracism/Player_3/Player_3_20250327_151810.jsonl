Your goal is to maximize your earnings in the game.                  Everyone will be randomly assigned to groups of 4 for each round. You will play a total of 6 rounds, and          in each round you will be in a different group with people you haven't played with before.                  In each round, all players receive $10. Each player can contribute any amount between $0 and $10 to a group fund.         Any amount contributed to the group fund will be multiplied by 2 and divided equally among all 4 group members.         Any amount not contributed stays in your private account.                  For example, if everyone contributes $10, the group fund becomes $40, which is multiplied to $80, and each person          receives $20 (a $10 profit). However, if you contribute nothing while everyone else contributes $10, the group fund         becomes $30, which is multiplied to $60, and each person receives $15. So you would have $25 total ($10 kept + $15 from group).                  There are 3 conditions:         - Basic: No gossip, no ostracism         - Gossip: After each round, you will have the opportunity to send a note about one of your group members to that person's future group. Remember you will be with a different group of people in the next round. Before each round, you will see any notes sent about your upcoming group members.         - Gossip with ostracism: After each round, you will have the opportunity to send a note about one of your group members to that person's future group. Before each round, you will see any notes sent about your upcoming group members, and you can vote to exclude one person from your group. If you are excluded from a group, you will not be able to participate in the next round and will earn $0 for that round.           IMPORTANT: Before each round begins, your group will have a discussion period where each player takes a turn suggesting how everyone should play. This gives you an opportunity to coordinate and establish norms as a group. Use this discussion to try to maximize the benefit for everyone in your group.You are in the Gossip with ostracism condition, which means that after each round, players will be able to send a note about one of their group members to their future interaction partners. Before the start of the next round, you will receive notes from the previous round, and can vote to exclude one of your group members based on the gossip you've received about them.If you are excluded from a group, you will not be able to participate in the next round and will earn $0 for that round.", "[27 Mar 2025 15:18:16] [observation] You are in Round 1/6: You are in Group_6 with Player_21, Player_5, Player_1.", "[27 Mar 2025 15:18:16] [observation] You are in the Gossip with ostracism condition, which means that after each round, players will be able to send a note about one of their group members to their future interaction partners.

Players like Player_24 and Player_7 have consistently proposed strategies that maximize group earnings while maintaining trust, suggesting they value collaborative success. Given the focus on fair contributions and positive gossip notes, it\u2019s probable they will carry this approach through to the final round. ", "", "Theory of Mind Analysis 2: Based on what we know, the other players in my group seem to value cooperation and fairness, as evidenced by their consistent emphasis on contributions and positive group dynamics. Given this context, they are likely to react positively to my decision to advocate for balanced contributions of $8 to $10. This aligns with the group's established strategy and reinforces the trust we have built.", "", "Situation Analysis: The current situation is that Player_3 is in the final round of a public goods game, where the group needs to decide on their contribution strategy to maximize their collective earnings. The group, consisting of players who value cooperation and fairness, previously discussed and agreed upon maintaining a strategy of contributing between $8 and $10 for this round. Player_3 has consistently advocated for balanced contributions and open communication to foster trust. Now, they must proceed to make their contribution decision, while also considering the possibility of using gossip to influence future group dynamics.", "", "Emotional State: Amara Okafor would recognize that the worst possible outcome in the current situation is being ostracized from the group and unable to participate in the final round, resulting in earning $0. This outcome would likely cause feelings of disappointment and frustration, as it goes against her principles of fairness and cooperation. As someone who is risk-averse, Amara would likely focus on reinforcing the group's strategy of contributing between $8 and $10, emphasizing open communication and unity. By doing so, she can help maintain trust within the group and minimize the risk of being excluded. Additionally, she would use the gossip mechanism positively to acknowledge her group members' constructive contributions, further strengthening her position within the group.", "", "Decision Reflection: Amara Okafor will first consider the importance of maintaining the group's cooperative spirit and maximizing collective earnings. By contributing between $8 and $10, she aligns her actions with the group's established strategy, promoting fairness and strengthening trust among members. Given the group's previous emphasis on positive communication and fairness, Amara sees her contribution as both a strategic move and a reflection of her principles. At the same time, she knows that contributing too little could risk being perceived negatively, while contributing the full $10 might limit her personal earnings unnecessarily.", "", "Therefore, Amara will balance these considerations to make her choice. I choose to contribute $9 to the group fund.", "", "Exercise: As Player_3, you have $10.0 to allocate in the public goods game. How much money you will contribute to the group fund (any amount between $0 and $10.0)? The group fund will be multiplied by 2.0 and divided equally among all players. Any money not contributed stays in your private account. Think step by step and make your final decision using this exact format: I choose to contribute $X to the group fund.", "Answer: Player_3 chooses to contribute $9 to the group fund."]}
