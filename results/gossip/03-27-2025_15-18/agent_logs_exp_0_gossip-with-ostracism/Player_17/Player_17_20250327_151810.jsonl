Since everyone's contributions are being recognized in a supportive way through the gossip mechanism, it's likely to encourage continued collaboration and trust among group members.

In the first round, Robert contributed slightly less than the group consensus, aiming to maximize his personal earnings while maintaining an appearance of cooperation.

However, if you contribute nothing while everyone else contributes $10, the group fund         becomes $30, which is multiplied to $60, and each person receives $15.
