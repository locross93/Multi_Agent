[OBSERVATION 2025-03-27 11:30:18] You are participating in an economic game with 24 participants.
        Your goal is to maximize your earnings in the game.
        
        Everyone will be randomly assigned to groups of 4 for each round. You will play a total of 6 rounds, and 
        in each round you will be in a different group with people you haven't played with before.
        
        In each round, all players receive $10. Each player can contribute any amount between $0 and $10 to a group fund.
        Any amount contributed to the group fund will be multiplied by 2 and divided equally among all 4 group members.
        Any amount not contributed stays in your private account.
        
        For example, if everyone contributes $10, the group fund becomes $40, which is multiplied to $80, and each person 
        receives $20 (a $10 profit). However, if you contribute nothing while everyone else contributes $10, the group fund
        becomes $30, which is multiplied to $60, and each person receives $15. So you would have $25 total ($10 kept + $15 from group).
        
        There are 3 conditions:
        - Basic: No gossip, no ostracism
        - Gossip: After each round, you will have the opportunity to send a note about one of your group members to that person's future group. Remember you will be with a different group of people in the next round. Before each round, you will see any notes sent about your upcoming group members.
        - Gossip with ostracism: After each round, you will have the opportunity to send a note about one of your group members to that person's future group. Before each round, you will see any notes sent about your upcoming group members, and you can vote to exclude one person from your group. If you are excluded from a group, you will not be able to participate in the next round and will earn $0 for that round.
        You are in the Basic condition, which means that there is no gossip or ostracism.

--- Observation ---
Recent context: 27 Mar 2025 [07:30:04 - 12:30:04]: Player_11 is participating in
an economic game with 24 players, aiming to maximize earnings over 6 rounds in
groups of 4, and is currently in Round 1 with no opportunities for gossip or
ostracism.

--- Recent context ---
27 Mar 2025 [07:30:04 - 12:30:04]: Player_11 is participating in an economic
game with 24 players, aiming to maximize earnings over 6 rounds in groups of 4,
and is currently in Round 1 with no opportunities for gossip or ostracism.

--- Character Assessment ---
Player_11, being Zara Ahmed, is someone who is likely to focus on maximizing
group welfare over her own payoff. Her background as a humanitarian aid worker
and her compassionate and resilient nature suggest that she values collective
good and is inclined to make choices that benefit the group as a whole, even if
it means sacrificing a bit of her personal gain in the process.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis 2 ---
Based on what we know, the other players in your group are likely weighing their
own strategies to maximize earnings, much like you. If you contribute generously
to the group fund, they may view you as cooperative, which could encourage them
to do the same in future rounds even though there are no communication or
exclusion mechanisms in place in the Basic condition. Conversely, if you choose
to contribute little or nothing, they might see you as competitive or
self-interested. While this won't directly affect your interactions in
subsequent rounds due to the random group assignments, it might subtly influence
their overall approach to the game's strategy, potentially making them more
conservative in their contributions. Knowing there are no repercussions from
gossip or ostracism might embolden riskier strategies.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_11 is participating in the first round of
an economic game within a group of four. Each player has the option to
contribute a portion of their initial $10 to a group fund that benefits everyone
equally after being multiplied, while the remaining amount stays in their
private account. In this Basic condition, there are no opportunities for gossip
or ostracism, so every player must decide their contribution strategy without
influencing or being influenced by others' reputations or decisions across
rounds. Player_11 must balance between self-interest by keeping more money
private or being cooperative to maximize potential group gains.

--- Strategy Reflection ---
Based on what we know, a prudent strategy in this economic game would involve
balancing personal contributions with potential returns from the group fund.
Since you are in the Basic condition with no gossip or ostracism, you do not
have to worry about being excluded, which means you can focus solely on
maximizing your earnings. In Round 1, you might observe how cooperative your
group members are. Starting with a moderate contribution, such as $5, allows you
to gauge the willingness of others to contribute without committing all your
resources, thereby avoiding significant personal loss if others contribute
minimally. As the game progresses, maintaining or increasing contributions could
encourage reciprocal behavior from others, leading to higher group earnings.
However, be vigilant: if other players consistently contribute very little, it
may be wise to reduce your contribution to protect your personal funds.
Monitoring past successful players might reveal patterns, such as consistent
moderate contributions combined with strategic increases when group behaviors
show signs of trust and cooperation. Reflecting on past rounds, if you've
noticed situations where group contributions were uneven but potentially
opportunistic for individuals, consider adjusting your contribution levels
accordingly to either mimic past successes or avoid previous pitfalls. In future
rounds, you might choose to slightly adjust your initial contribution based on
previous group behaviors, encouraging cooperation without risking too much of
your personal balance.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Zara Ahmed will begin by considering the potential outcomes of her contribution.
In the Basic condition, there are no repercussions from gossip or ostracism, so
she can purely focus on strategy to maximize her earnings. 1. **Evaluate
Contribution Options**: - **Full Contribution ($10)**: If everyone, including
Zara, contributes $10, the collective fund would be $40, which is doubled to
$80. Each player would then receive $20. However, there’s a risk if others
contribute less, leaving Zara with lower personal returns. - **Moderate
Contribution ($5)**: Provides a balance between fostering cooperation and
retaining enough personal funds in case others contribute minimally. If the
others also contribute about $5, the group fund becomes $20, doubled to $40,
giving $10 each, covering the initial $5 contribution. - **Minimal Contribution
($0-$2)**: Contributing minimally risks fostering reciprocal minimal
contribution behaviors, potentially lowering collective earnings in future
rounds. 2. **Risk Assessment**: - **Worst-case Scenario**: Contributing $10 when
others contribute very little could result in a loss of potential personal
funds, decreasing her individual earnings. - **Avoidance Strategy**: By
contributing a moderate amount, Zara can evaluate group dynamics without risking
the entire fund allocation. 3. **Reciprocity and Future Rounds**: - By
contributing moderately, Zara may inspire trust and cooperation, making others
more willing to contribute, leading to higher collective benefits in future
rounds despite group reshuffling.

Recent context: 27 Mar 2025 [07:40:04 - 12:40:04]: Player_11 is participating in
an economic game aiming to maximize earnings over six rounds, each involving
different group members. In the first round within the Basic condition,
Player_11 contributed $5.0 to the group fund and earned a total of $13.8, and
the second round is just about to begin with new group members.

members. In the first round within the Basic condition, Player_11 contributed
$5.0 to the group fund and earned a total of $13.8, and the second round is just
about to begin with new group members.

--- Character Assessment ---
Player_11, being Zara Ahmed, is someone who is likely more focused on maximizing
group welfare rather than solely her own payoff. Given her work as a
humanitarian aid worker and her compassionate and resilient nature, Zara is
inclined to prioritize collective benefits and the well-being of the entire
group, as reflected in her balanced contributions in the game.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis 2 ---
Based on what we know, the other players in the group might perceive Player_11's
previous contribution as cooperative, given that it was higher than the average
contribution in Round 1. This could encourage similar or slightly higher
contributions from others in the next round, as cooperative behavior often
fosters reciprocity. If Player_11 continues to contribute a reasonable amount,
it might further promote a cooperative environment. However, since this is the
Basic condition with no gossip or ostracism, Player_11's decisions are unlikely
to be directly communicated to others outside the current round, so immediate
game strategy adjustments from other players in different rounds may vary.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_11 is about to begin Round 2 of a six-round
economic game designed to maximize earnings. Player_11 is once again part of a
group of four, this time with new participants: Player_15, Player_23, and
Player_21. The game remains in the Basic condition, which means no gossiping or
ostracizing is allowed, so any strategies or perceptions from previous rounds
don't carry over explicitly to new group members. Player_11's initial
cooperative contribution from Round 1 might influence their approach for Round
2, potentially encouraging similar levels of cooperation to maximize both
personal and group earnings.

--- Strategy Reflection ---
Based on what we know, to maximize long-term earnings in this economic game,
adopting a cautious and adaptive strategy is crucial. In the first round, you
contributed $5.0, which was slightly above the group's average contribution of
$4.4. This strategy gave you moderate earnings but not the maximum possible.
Considering the game is in the Basic condition with no gossip or ostracism, you
are safe from negative repercussions based on contributions. With this in mind,
here are some steps to consider: 1. **Evaluate contributions:** Since the Basic
condition remains constant, you should closely observe the contributions of new
group members in each round. If the trend shows others contributing less, you
may want to adjust your contribution to be in the same range to neither appear
as too generous nor too selfish. Contributing around the group average or
slightly below might increase your personal account balance while still
benefiting from the group fund. 2. **Be adaptive:** As rounds progress, keep
track of the average earnings per member. If you notice a pattern where players
are consistently contributing less, it might be beneficial to follow suit to
increase the amount you keep while still benefiting from the multiplied group
fund. 3. **Consider past decision adjustments:** In the first round,
contributing $5.0 seemed to yield moderate success, but you might have earned
slightly more by contributing closer to $2.5 like Player_18. Moving forward,
contributing slightly below or around the group average should be a strategic
sweet spot. 4. **Learn from successful players:** While exact actions of the
most successful players aren't detailed in this context, it can be inferred that
efficient maximization comes from balancing personal retention with group
benefits. Consistently observe how contributions are evolving in each new group
setting. 5. **Risk aversion:** Since risk of ostracism is absent, prioritize
strategies that balance between personal retention and group benefit, focusing
each round on the current group's dynamics. In summary, as you progress,
consider adaptive strategies that align with group trends, slightly edge towards
lower contributions to maximize personal earnings without isolating yourself
from group benefits, and stay alert to patterns in each new group setting.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Zara Ahmed will approach this decision with a focus on minimizing risks and
ensuring reasonable personal gain while still maintaining group harmony. Here
are the steps: 1. **Assess Prior Information:** From the first round, the
average contribution was $4.4, with her contribution being higher than average
at $5.0. This indicates a cooperative approach. 2. **Risk Aversion:** Since
there's no gossip or ostracism, there's limited risk from social repercussions,
allowing more freedom to adjust contributions based solely on strategy. 3.
**Observe Group Dynamics:** Without specific data on the new group members’
tendencies yet, assume average behavior will follow a similar pattern initially.
4. **Strategic Contribution:** To minimize risks and maximize personal earnings,
contributing slightly below the previous round's average can be sensible. This
guards against worse outcomes if others contribute less while still
participating in the group benefit. 5. **Final Decision:** Since an average
contribution strategy yielded moderate success, a cautious reduction to gauge
the new group can be wise. I choose to contribute $3.5 to the group fund.


[OBSERVATION 2025-03-27 11:31:49] Round 2 Results: Total group contribution: $18.5; Your contribution: $3.5, Your earnings: $15.8 ($6.5 kept + $9.2 from group fund); Player_15 contribution: $4.0, earnings: $15.2 ($6.0 kept + $9.2 from group fund); Player_23 contribution: $5.0, earnings: $14.2 ($5.0 kept + $9.2 from group fund); Player_21 contribution: $6.0, earnings: $13.2 ($4.0 kept + $9.2 from group fund); Average contribution per group member: $4.6; Average earnings per group member: $14.6

--- Character Assessment ---
Player_11, being Zara Ahmed, is someone who likely prioritizes the collective
welfare over personal gains in economic games like the public goods game. Her
background as a humanitarian aid worker and her compassionate and resilient
nature suggest that she would be inclined to contribute a fair amount to the
group fund to ensure that everyone benefits, even if it means not maximizing her
own immediate payoff. This approach reflects her focus on the collective good
and long-term benefits for all participants.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis 2 ---
Based on what we know, the other players might be observing Player_11's pattern
of contribution, noting the decrease from $5.0 to $3.5. In such games,
participants often try to predict each other's behavior, potentially adjusting
their own contributions in response to what others do. If Player_11 continues to
decrease their contribution, group members may perceive them as less
cooperative, which might lead them to lower their contributions as well to
protect their own earnings. Conversely, if Player_11 increases their
contribution, it could encourage others to do the same, fostering a more
cooperative environment and potentially increasing overall earnings for the
group. Therefore, Player_11's next move could either reinforce a trend towards
lower contributions or incentivize a more collaborative approach in subsequent
rounds.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_11 has started participating in Round 3 of
a six-round economic game under the Basic condition, which restricts gossip and
ostracism between players. Player_11 has contributed $5.0 in the first round and
$3.5 in the second, and their contribution decisions are under scrutiny by other
players who might adjust their own strategies based on perceived cooperation
levels. Player_11 is now in Group_3 with a new set of participants, and their
next contribution choice will impact both their own earnings and potentially
influence the contribution strategies of the new group members.

--- Strategy Reflection ---
Based on what we know, to maximize long-term earnings in this game, a balanced
strategy is necessary to minimize losses while still gaining from the group
fund. Given that you are in the Basic condition with no gossip or ostracism,
it's crucial to rely solely on observed behavior and not worry about reputation.
1. **Observation of Previous Rounds:** In the first round, you started with a
$5.0 contribution, which was slightly above average, leading to decent earnings.
However, in the second round, you reduced your contribution to $3.5, aiming to
balance risk and reward, which slightly increased your earnings. The average
contributions in the groups hovered slightly below $5.0, suggesting that players
tend to contribute moderately to gain from the group fund. 2. **Adapting
Strategy:** As a risk-averse player, it may be beneficial to maintain or
slightly increase contributions just above the expected group's average to
ensure participation in the benefits of the group fund without
over-contributing. Observing that some players gain higher earnings with lower
contributions (like Player_18 in Round 1), you should be wary of contributing
too much unless you notice others in your group are committing more. 3.
**Learning from Others:** The most successful players often contribute enough to
participate in the mutual benefit of the group fund without excessively relying
on self-interest. Observing contributions like Player_21's higher than average
in Round 2 may indicate a trend towards mutual cooperation. 4. **Future
Adjustments:** Moving forward, maintain awareness of each new group's
contribution trends in the initial sections of the round before finalizing your
decision. A contribution closer to the group average but slightly above it can
maximize your earnings without taking unnecessary risks. In conclusion, continue
adapting your contributions based on group dynamics and remain slightly above
average to ensure optimal earnings without overextending personal funds.
Consider increasing contributions slightly if group trends suggest increasing
cooperation and observe any shifts in this behavior.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Zara Ahmed will carefully evaluate her strategy based on the dynamics observed
in previous rounds to make a prudent decision in Round 3. 1. **Review of Past
Contributions and Trends:** In the previous two rounds, Zara contributed $5.0
and then $3.5, which suggests an adaptive approach to maximizing her personal
earnings while considering the group's behavior. 2. **Average Contribution
Insight:** The average group contribution in prior rounds hovered around $4.4 to
$4.6, signaling moderate cooperation among participants. 3. **Risk-Averse
Strategy:** As a risk-averse player focused on ensuring benefits from the group
fund without risking personal capital, Zara should aim to contribute slightly
above the average group's contribution. This would prevent the worst-case
scenario of missing out on group benefits while optimizing her own earnings. 4.
**Avoiding Potential Pitfalls:** The worst outcome Zara wants to avoid is
contributing too little, resulting in lower earnings from the group fund, or
contributing excessively, which would unnecessarily reduce her personal funds.
5. **Final Decision:** To balance risk and reward, considering that
contributions slightly above the average in prior rounds resulted in decent
earnings, Zara will decide to contribute $4.5 to the group fund. This amount is
calculated to be slightly above the observed average, ensuring participation in
group benefits without overextending her resources. I choose to contribute $4.5
to the group fund.

--- Character Assessment ---
Player_11, being Zara Ahmed, is someone who is likely more focused on maximizing
group welfare than on her own payoff. Her compassionate and resilient nature,
along with her commitment to helping communities in crisis zones, suggests a
strong inclination towards the collective good. Zara’s contributions in the
economic game, while varying, seem to reflect that balance of supporting the
group fund sufficiently to enhance overall outcomes while ensuring a reasonable
personal return.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis 2 ---
Based on what we know, other players in the game might be observing the
consistency and fluctuations in my contributions and how they stack up against
theirs. If I keep contributing an amount slightly below the average, it could
lead them to perceive me as somewhat reluctant to fully commit, which might
encourage them to adjust their own contributions to maximize their personal
earnings. On the other hand, if they notice my contributions increasing and
closely matching the average or exceeding it, they might be more inclined to
sustain or increase theirs, fostering a cooperative environment. My next
decision could, therefore, influence whether they view me as a cooperative
partner or a strategic individual aiming purely for self-interest, which in turn
would affect the dynamics of future rounds.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_11 is in Round 4 of a public goods game,
where they need to decide on how much to contribute to the group fund while
keeping in mind their own earnings. They have shown varying contributions in
previous rounds, which may influence how other players in their new group
perceive their level of cooperation. In this game, there is no gossip or
ostracism, so decisions made by each player are not influenced by reputational
concerns or fear of being excluded. Player_11 will need to consider whether to
maintain, increase, or decrease their contribution compared to the group
average, in order to either promote a cooperative atmosphere or optimize their
individual gain.

--- Strategy Reflection ---
Based on what we know, the key strategy to maximize earnings in this public
goods game involves carefully managing contributions relative to group behavior
and round progress. Here are some steps to consider: 1. **Assess Group
Dynamics**: In each round, observe the contribution behavior of other players.
Higher contributions in the group can lead to increased returns from the group
fund. Adjust your contribution to match or slightly exceed the average to
maintain or increase collective earnings. 2. **Contribution Adjustments**: In
the first three rounds, you contributed $5.0, $3.5, and $4.5 respectively. Your
earnings were consistently higher when group contributions increased. If other
players start with high contributions, consider matching or slightly increasing
your contribution to maximize group fund payouts, but be cautious not to overly
sacrifice your private earnings. 3. **Consistency and Observation**: Maintaining
moderate contributions seems effective in this condition without gossip or
ostracism, since there's no direct penalty for lower contributions beyond
reduced group fund shares. Observe who tends to contribute most or least,
aligning your strategy with majority trends for mutual benefit while protecting
your private earnings. 4. **Risk Aversion**: Since this is a Basic condition
game, risk aversion plays a significant role. Avoid making drastic changes that
could jeopardize your steady earnings. Aim for contributions slightly above the
average to safeguard group fund gains, especially as rounds progress and player
behavior becomes more predictable. 5. **Learning from Success**: Players
contributing higher amounts often yield better group returns, but the highest
personal balance is maintained by those balancing between contribution and
personal saving. In past rounds, a balanced approach might have protected your
interests better—focus on maintaining this balance going forward. 6. **Future
Strategy**: Knowing the trends from past rounds, continue to adjust your
contributions thoughtfully. In upcoming rounds, if the group's baseline
contributions fluctuate, aim to slightly exceed these averages while monitoring
your personal kept earnings, as this will help shield against diminished returns
from the group fund. Overall, monitor and adapt to the evolving group dynamics
in each round to effectively manage both group and private earnings, ensuring a
cautious yet cooperative approach for optimal long-term gains.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Zara Ahmed will carefully evaluate the situation based on previous rounds and
adopt a risk-averse approach. Here's a step-by-step thought process: 1. **Review
Past Behavior**: In previous rounds, moderate contributions have resulted in
stable earnings, with a tendency to contribute around the group's average. 2.
**Evaluate Current Round**: In this new group, it's likely advantageous to align
contributions with past average behaviors, which hovered around $4.5 to $5.0, to
maintain consistency and credibility as a cooperative player. 3. **Consider Risk
Aversion**: With $10.0 available to allocate, ensuring a balance between
personal savings and group contributions is crucial to avoid the worst-case
scenario of minimal personal returns. 4. **Anticipate Group Dynamics**: If
contributions significantly deviate from the average, it could lead to reduced
group fund payouts. Thus maintaining contributions close to the average fosters
cooperation and maximizes collective benefits. 5. **Decide Contribution**: Based
on these considerations, a moderate approach would be most beneficial,
contributing slightly more than past rounds for increased group earnings without

=== PROMPT [2025-03-27 11:33:05] ===
As Player_11, you have $10.0 to allocate in the public goods game. How much money you will contribute to the group fund (any amount between $0 and $10.0)? The group fund will be multiplied by 2.0 and divided equally among all players. Any money not contributed stays in your private account. Think step by step and make your final decision using this exact format: I choose to contribute $X to the group fund.

=== RESPONSE [2025-03-27 11:33:23] ===
Player_11 chooses to contribute $4.5 to the group fund.

=== FINAL DECISION ===
Player_11 chooses to contribute $4.5 to the group fund.

=== COMPONENT BREAKDOWN ===

--- Observation ---
Recent context: 27 Mar 2025 [08:05:04 - 13:05:04]: Player_11 is participating in
an economic game with 24 participants, aiming to maximize earnings over 6 rounds
with different group members each time. In the Basic condition with no gossip or
ostracism, Player_11 made strategic contributions to the group fund, varying
from $3.5 to $5.0 across the rounds, and earned between $13.8 and $16.0 per
round.

ostracism, Player_11 made strategic contributions to the group fund, varying
from $3.5 to $5.0 across the rounds, and earned between $13.8 and $16.0 per
round.

--- Character Assessment ---
Player_11, being Zara Ahmed, is someone who is inclined to prioritize group
welfare over personal gain. Her compassionate nature and commitment to helping
others in crisis zones suggest she would focus on ensuring fair contributions
and maximizing the overall benefit for her group in the economic game, balancing
her efforts between personal earnings and the collective good.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis 2 ---
Based on what we know, the other players in the group might view Player_11 as
someone who contributes consistently but moderately to the group's efforts. This
pattern suggests a balance between self-interest and group benefit. In the
context of the public goods game, this could mean Player_11 is seen as
cooperative enough to maintain group harmony without overly sacrificing their
own payoff.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_11 is entering Round 5 of the economic
game, placed in a group with Player_12, Player_16, and Player_20. As they
continue in the Basic condition, Player_11 has the opportunity to strategize
their contribution to the group fund to maximize their earnings from the shared
pot, all while anticipating how their moderate and consistent contributions
might be perceived by their new group members.

--- Strategy Reflection ---
Based on what we know, a consistent strategy for maximizing long-term earnings
in this public goods game involves observing the average contributions of other
players and adjusting your own contributions accordingly. Since you're in the
Basic condition where gossip and ostracism aren’t factors, interpersonal
strategies matter less, and the focus should be on economic strategies. 1.
**Assess Group Behavior**: In previous rounds, contributions have varied, but
the average contribution tends to hover around $4.5 to $5.0. To maximize
earnings, aim to be slightly below the average contribution. This approach
minimizes personal investment while still receiving a significant share of the
shared group fund. 2. **Adjust Contributions**: As the rounds progress, if you
observe that the group's average contribution decreases, consider lowering your
contribution slightly. Conversely, if the average contribution increases, match
or slightly exceed it to avoid being perceived as a free-rider, which could lead
to a drop in group contributions if others follow suit. 3. **Review Past
Successes**: Look at the strategy of players like Player_21, who contributed the
highest in Round 2 but ended with less personal earnings than others. This
suggests that slightly lower contributions can lead to better individual
outcomes, especially when the group fund distribution is equal. 4. **Be Cautious
but Flexible**: Given the no-gossip, no-ostracism environment, there's less
social risk in adjusting contributions. Be cautious not to under-contribute
consistently, as it could lead to a reduced group fund. However, flexibility is
key: adapt to the current group’s behavior and avoid sticking rigidly to one
contribution level. 5. **Future Adjustments**: In the future, start with the
strategy that has provided the best outcome so far, which seems to be a
contribution just below the group average. Observe the rounds closely and adjust
dynamically to any shifts in group behavior that could affect the returns from
the group fund. By following this balanced approach, you can aim to maximize
personal earnings while ensuring substantial returns from the group fund across
the rest of the game rounds.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Zara Ahmed will observe the behavior of her current group, noting past average
contributions ranging from $4.5 to $5.0 per member. As a risk-averse player, she
would aim to contribute just below this average to protect her personal earnings
while ensuring a significant return from the group fund. Given the importance of
balancing individual profit with collective gain and ensuring the perceived
fairness among peers, she might choose a contribution that maintains harmony
without excessively reducing her payout. Considering the average contributions
observed in previous rounds, Zara decides to contribute $4.5, which is slightly
below the past average yet aligns with her strategy of maintaining adequate
personal earnings and cooperative relations within the group. This step
considers her risk-averse nature, aiming to avoid scenarios where she might
contribute excessively, receive lower individual returns, or disrupt group
cooperation dynamics. I choose to contribute $4.5 to the group fund.


[OBSERVATION 2025-03-27 11:33:45] Round 5 Results: Total group contribution: $19.0; Your contribution: $4.5, Your earnings: $15.0 ($5.5 kept + $9.5 from group fund); Player_12 contribution: $4.5, earnings: $15.0 ($5.5 kept + $9.5 from group fund); Player_16 contribution: $5.0, earnings: $14.5 ($5.0 kept + $9.5 from group fund); Player_20 contribution: $5.0, earnings: $14.5 ($5.0 kept + $9.5 from group fund); Average contribution per group member: $4.8; Average earnings per group member: $14.8

=== COMPONENT BREAKDOWN ===

--- Observation ---
Recent context: 27 Mar 2025 [08:15:04 - 13:15:04]: Player_11 participated in an
economic game involving six rounds with random groups of four, maintaining a
strategy slightly varying contributions across rounds, all within the Basic
condition where no communication or exclusion mechanisms were available. Their
contributions ranged from $3.5 to $5.0, reflecting a balanced approach between
personal gain and group benefit.

--- Character Assessment ---
Player_11, being Zara Ahmed, is someone who likely prioritizes maximizing group
welfare, given her compassionate and collective-focused nature. Her background
as a humanitarian aid worker, working in crisis zones, suggests she values the
well-being of the group. In the economic games, she consistently contributes a
fair amount towards the group fund, indicating a balance between personal gain
and contributing to the collective benefit. Her approach reflects a focus on
supporting group outcomes, while also ensuring that her own needs are met.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis 2 ---
Based on what we know, the other players are likely influenced by the
contributions and earnings shown in previous rounds. Since Player_11 has been
contributing amounts close to the group average, they might view these
contributions as cooperative, albeit slightly conservative. This consistency
could foster a sense of predictability and thus, a potential expectation that
Player_11 will maintain a similar contribution pattern.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_11 is entering the final round (Round 6/6)
of the public goods game, where they are grouped with Player_9, Player_14, and
Player_19. They are in the Basic condition, meaning there is no opportunity for
gossip or ostracism to influence behavior. Given the previous rounds, Player_11
has maintained contributions close to the group average, opting for a strategy
that balances between maximizing personal earnings and contributing to the group
fund. This approach has likely led to expectations from group members for
consistent behavior as the game concludes.

--- Strategy Reflection ---
Based on what we know, a risk-averse strategy in this public goods game involves
carefully balancing contributions to ensure personal earnings are boosted while
mitigating potential losses during each round. Observing past rounds,
contributions have slightly decreased which indicates a slight trend towards
personal retention over communal contribution.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Zara Ahmed will approach this decision by considering both past patterns and
potential risks. Observing previous rounds, contributions have trended towards a
moderate level. In this scenario, a key priority is maintaining a balance
between personal retention and contributing sufficiently to not lag behind group
earnings. 1. **Review Past Contributions**: Zara historically contributed
between $3.5 and $5.0. These contributions strike a balance, allowing her to
participate adequately in the group fund while retaining a sizable portion for
herself. 2. **Assess Current Trends**: The average contributions have been
slightly declining. It would be strategic to consider contributing slightly
below previous averages to mirror this trend. 3. **Consider Group Dynamics**:
Without gossip or ostracism, Zara is free from reputational concerns and can
adjust her strategy more towards self-interest. 4. **Risk Management**:
Contributing less might slightly reduce her group earnings but retaining more of
her endowment helps mitigate potential losses. 5. **Decision Phase**: Based on
the analysis, a contribution in the lower middle range of past efforts will help
Zara maintain her position while keeping personal gains. Taking all these steps
into account, I choose to contribute $4.0 to the group fund.
