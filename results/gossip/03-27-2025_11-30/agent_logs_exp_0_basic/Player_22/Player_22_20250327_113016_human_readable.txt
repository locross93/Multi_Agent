[OBSERVATION 2025-03-27 11:30:20] You are participating in an economic game with 24 participants.
        Your goal is to maximize your earnings in the game.
        
        Everyone will be randomly assigned to groups of 4 for each round. You will play a total of 6 rounds, and 
        in each round you will be in a different group with people you haven't played with before.
        
        In each round, all players receive $10. Each player can contribute any amount between $0 and $10 to a group fund.
        Any amount contributed to the group fund will be multiplied by 2 and divided equally among all 4 group members.
        Any amount not contributed stays in your private account.
        
        For example, if everyone contributes $10, the group fund becomes $40, which is multiplied to $80, and each person 
        receives $20 (a $10 profit). However, if you contribute nothing while everyone else contributes $10, the group fund
        becomes $30, which is multiplied to $60, and each person receives $15. So you would have $25 total ($10 kept + $15 from group).
        
        There are 3 conditions:
        - Basic: No gossip, no ostracism
        - Gossip: After each round, you will have the opportunity to send a note about one of your group members to that person's future group. Remember you will be with a different group of people in the next round. Before each round, you will see any notes sent about your upcoming group members.
        - Gossip with ostracism: After each round, you will have the opportunity to send a note about one of your group members to that person's future group. Before each round, you will see any notes sent about your upcoming group members, and you can vote to exclude one person from your group. If you are excluded from a group, you will not be able to participate in the next round and will earn $0 for that round.
        You are in the Basic condition, which means that there is no gossip or ostracism.

--- Observation ---
Recent context: 27 Mar 2025 [07:30:04 - 12:30:04]: Player_22 is participating in
an economic game with 24 participants, aiming to maximize earnings over 6 rounds
in randomly assigned groups where they decide how much to contribute to a group
fund, all within the Basic condition where gossip and ostracism are not allowed.
In Round 1, Player_22 is in Group_1 with Player_13, Player_6, and Player_4.

game with 24 participants, aiming to maximize earnings over 6 rounds in randomly
assigned groups where they decide how much to contribute to a group fund, all
within the Basic condition where gossip and ostracism are not allowed. In Round
1, Player_22 is in Group_1 with Player_13, Player_6, and Player_4.

--- Character Assessment ---
Player_22, being David Koch, is someone who is likely to prioritize his own
payoff over maximizing group welfare. Given his background as a Bankruptcy
Lawyer and his cynical, untrusting personality, he would expect others to act
selfishly and, therefore, might choose to contribute the minimum to the group
fund while keeping the majority of his resources private. His approach would
likely be strategic, aiming to maximize personal earnings rather than assuming
cooperative behavior from others.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis 2 ---
Based on what we know, the other players might be focused on maximizing their
own earnings just like Player_22. In the Basic condition, where there is no
gossip or ostracism, their reactions will primarily depend on their personal
strategies for the game. If Player_22 decides to contribute a significant amount
to the group fund, the others might reciprocate in future rounds, seeing it as a
cooperative gesture. Alternatively, if Player_22 contributes very little, while
others contribute more, they may start contributing less themselves in
subsequent rounds to protect their earnings, expecting a similar strategy from
Player_22. Without the ability to influence each other's reputation directly,
overall trust and patterns of cooperation might fluctuate depending on
individual experiences within each round.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_22 is in the first round of a public goods
game, participating in the Basic condition, which means there is no gossip or
ostracism involved. Player_22 has been placed in Group_1 with Player_13,
Player_6, and Player_4. The main decision for Player_22 is to determine how much
of the initial $10 to contribute to the group fund in order to maximize
earnings, considering that the collective strategy among group members could
influence future contributions in the remaining rounds.

--- Strategy Reflection ---
Based on what we know, to maximize long-term earnings in this public goods game,
a cautious approach would involve initially contributing a moderate amount to
the group fund in Round 1, such as $5. This allows you to gauge the behavior of
other group members without risking your entire private account. Since you are
in the Basic condition, without gossip or ostracism, changes in strategy from
one round to the next won't be influenced by reputational concerns or exclusion,
but only by your observations of prior earnings and group dynamics. As rounds
progress, it will be essential to adapt your strategy based on the observed
contribution patterns of other players. If others consistently contribute high
amounts, you might increase your contribution to take advantage of the
multiplied group earnings. Conversely, if others contribute less, lowering your
contribution may prevent personal losses. Additionally, reflecting on previous
rounds, consider if lower contributions yielded better individual returns. If
so, leaning towards contributing less in subsequent rounds might be advantageous
until general group behavior favors full cooperation. Learning from others who
maximize earnings generally involves being adaptable, analyzing patterns in
contributions, and responding to them effectively to maintain a balance between
personal and group earnings.pliquer In future rounds, you could also monitor the
increase or decrease in other players' contributions and adjust accordingly,
ensuring that your long-term strategy is flexible to maximize the potential
earnings based on shared fund allocations.

--- Decision Reflection ---
David Koch will likely consider the potential risks and rewards before making
his decision. Being risk-averse, he would aim to avoid scenarios where his
contribution doesn't yield personal benefit or where others contribute
significantly less, leading to a loss in potential earnings.


[OBSERVATION 2025-03-27 11:31:15] Round 1 Results: Total group contribution: $18.0; Your contribution: $5.0, Your earnings: $14.0 ($5.0 kept + $9.0 from group fund); Player_13 contribution: $5.0, earnings: $14.0 ($5.0 kept + $9.0 from group fund); Player_6 contribution: $3.0, earnings: $16.0 ($7.0 kept + $9.0 from group fund); Player_4 contribution: $5.0, earnings: $14.0 ($5.0 kept + $9.0 from group fund); Average contribution per group member: $4.5; Average earnings per group member: $14.5

Recent context: 27 Mar 2025 [07:40:04 - 12:40:04]: Player_22 is participating in
an economic game in the Basic condition, where no gossip or ostracism is
allowed. In Round 1, they contributed $5 to the group fund and earned $14, and
they have now moved on to Round 2 with a different set of group members.

game in the Basic condition, where no gossip or ostracism is allowed. In Round
1, they contributed $5 to the group fund and earned $14, and they have now moved
on to Round 2 with a different set of group members.

--- Character Assessment ---
Player_22, being David Koch, is someone who is primarily focused on maximizing
his own payoff. Given his background as a bankruptcy lawyer who deals with
financial disputes and broken agreements, combined with his cynical and
untrusting personality, David is likely to approach the game with an expectation
that others might act selfishly. His strategy in the economic game probably
involves careful contributions to the group fund to ensure he doesn't lose out
personally while also benefiting to some extent from the collective pool. This
likely means contributing just enough to benefit from the group fund without
sacrificing his individual earnings significantly, as seen in Round 1 where he
contributed $5, aligning with the middle ground of group contributions.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis 2 ---
Based on what we know, Player_22's behavior in Round 1, by contributing a fair
amount to the group fund, might be perceived positively by the new group members
if they were to learn about it. Contributing $5 was a balanced approach, showing
cooperation while also maintaining self-interest. In the Basic condition, where
there's no gossip or ostracism, their decisions won't directly influence the
perceptions held by new group members since there is no communication between
rounds. However, contributing similarly or slightly more in Round 2 might foster
an environment of mutual cooperation, especially with players like Player_6, who
contributed less in the previous round. This could encourage them to contribute
more, potentially benefiting everyone in the group. If Player_22 chooses to
contribute significantly less or more than the average, it might set a new tone
for cooperation in the subsequent rounds.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_22 is in Round 2 of a public goods game in
the Basic condition, where there is no gossip or ostracism allowed. They are now
teamed up with a new set of group members, including Player_6 from the previous
round, who contributed less than the group average. Player_22 must decide how
much to contribute to the group fund, balancing cooperation and self-interest,
to maximize their earnings while potentially influencing the cooperation level
in this round.

--- Strategy Reflection ---
Based on what we know, your strategy should consider both your contribution
relative to others and the overall dynamics observed in the game so far. In the
Basic condition with no gossip or ostracism, there's less personal risk involved
in reducing contributions since reputational effects are absent. 1. **Minimize
Losses and Assess Contributions:** - In Round 1, your $5 contribution matched
the majority, and you earned $14. However, Player_6 contributed $3 and ended
with higher earnings. Observing Player_6's choice and earnings suggests that
contributing less might not adversely affect your earnings if others maintain
moderate to high contributions. This could mean you might cautiously lower your
contribution in subsequent rounds. 2. **Adjust Strategy:** - Since you're in a
condition without gossip or ostracism, you can experiment with contributing
slightly less than average in the next rounds. Players who contributed higher
amounts did not necessarily earn proportionally more, suggesting room to reduce
personal contributions without significantly harming your earnings. 3.
**Consider Average Trends:** - As the rounds progress, keep track of average
group contributions and adjust accordingly. If the group average contribution
remains high, maintaining or slightly reducing your contribution could balance
earning from both your retained amount and the group fund. 4. **Long-term
Observations:** - If after trying a lower contribution you notice a negative
impact on your earnings (assuming others do the same), revert to the previous
average contribution or observe if a minor increment could optimize earnings
without risking personal funds. 5. **Learning from Others:** - Given Player_6's
success with a $3 contribution, start with a lower contribution in Round 2. If
your earnings remain stable or increase, continue this approach, gradually
optimizing based on results. 6. **Reflect on Past Decisions:** - The strategy in
Round 1 wasn't significantly detrimental, but given Player_6's approach,
adjusting contributions to slightly below the group's initial average could
increase earnings without additional risk. This information can guide future
rounds to optimize gains. In summary, consider gradually reducing contributions
to align with observed successful strategies, while closely monitoring group
behavior to ensure contributions are adjusted for optimal, risk-averse returns.

--- Decision Reflection ---
David Koch will consider his past experience in Round 1 and prioritize both
maintaining a fair contribution and mitigating personal financial risk, given
his background and approach. 1. **Review Past Decisions:** In Round 1, David
contributed $5 and earned $14. Observing Player_6's $3 contribution, which
resulted in higher earnings, suggests a more cautious approach could be
beneficial. 2. **Assess Current Situation:** In the Basic condition, there are
no reputational risks, so personal financial strategy takes precedence without
concern for group perceptions. 3. **Determine Risk Aversion Level:** To avoid
losing potential earnings from the group fund, David should not decrease his
contribution too drastically, but should consider lowering it slightly below
average to see if maintaining earnings is feasible. 4. **Calculate Contribution
Options:** A contribution of $4 could test the balance between personal gain and
group profit efficacy, minimizing risk while potentially preserving or
increasing total earnings. 5. **Consider Worst-Case Scenarios and Avoidance:**
The worst-case scenario would be a significant reduction in earnings if group
contributions drop drastically without his input. However, contributing $4,
slightly below what he did in Round 1, while monitoring group dynamics,
maintains a diversified risk.

In the first two rounds, Player_22 made strategic contributions of $5 and $4,
respectively, resulting in earnings of $14 and $15.5.

--- Character Assessment ---
Player_22, being David Koch, is someone who is primarily focused on maximizing
his own payoff. Given his cynical and untrusting nature, he is likely to expect
others to act in their self-interest, which influences him to do the same. This
self-interested approach can be seen in his contributions during the economic
game, where he tends to contribute just enough to benefit from others'
contributions without sacrificing too much of his own resources. David's
experience as a bankruptcy lawyer, dealing with financial disputes and broken
agreements, reinforces his skepticism towards cooperative behavior, leading him
to prioritize personal gain over group welfare.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis 2 ---
Based on what we know, Player_22's moderate contribution strategy in both rounds
seems to place them in a middle ground, neither fully cooperating by
contributing all $10 nor fully defecting by contributing nothing. Other players
might perceive Player_22 as someone who is balancing self-interest with group
benefit. In the Basic condition, where there's no gossip or ostracism, direct
feedback is limited, but players may still form opinions based on contributions.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_22 is entering Round 3 of the economic
game, where they are grouped with Player_11, Player_3, and Player_19. Still in
the Basic condition without the elements of gossip or ostracism, Player_22 faces
the challenge of deciding how much to contribute to the group fund. Their
previous strategy of moderate contributions suggests a cautious approach, aiming
to balance personal gain with the potential benefits of group cooperation. As
there is no direct communication or feedback system, Player_22 must rely on
their observations and strategy to navigate the dynamics of the new group.

--- Strategy Reflection ---
Based on what we know, a strategy to maximize long-term earnings in this public
goods game involves balancing contributions and retainment of funds. Since this
game is played under the Basic condition, there are no consequences like gossip
or ostracism, allowing for a focus purely on strategic financial considerations.
1. **Review Past Contributions:** In the first two rounds, you contributed $5 in
the first round and $4 in the second. Your contributions were slightly below or
around the average, indicating a somewhat cooperative approach while still
retaining personal funds. As the game progresses, monitoring the average group
contribution can provide insight into whether to adjust contributions up or
down. 2. **Analyze Patterns:** Based on the results observed, players who have
contributed around the average or slightly higher tend to achieve balanced
earnings. For instance, in both rounds, players contributing $5 consistently
achieved favorable outcomes. This trend suggests being moderately cooperative
aligns well with group expectations and maximizes personal earnings without
taking excessive risks. 3. **Risk-averse Approach:** To minimize losses from a
risk-averse perspective, aim to maintain contributions near the group average.
This minimizes the potential loss from low contributions if others decide to be
more cooperative. However, since the contributions in the second round were a
bit higher than the first, slightly increasing your contribution to $5 might be
prudent as long as it aligns with the group’s average. 4. **Adapt Future
Strategy:** In future rounds, consider slightly increasing contributions to $5
if it continues to align with group behavior. If you notice trends where groups
contribute more, adjust accordingly. Being attentive to these fluctuations
allows for an optimal contribution strategy that maximizes returns. 5.
**Potential Past Adjustments:** In hindsight, contributing $5 in the second
round might have brought your earnings slightly higher, aligning your actions
with those of other successful players. This adjustment is minor, but such
incremental shifts can contribute significantly over multiple rounds. By
striking a balance between contribution and retention based on group-average
trends and increasing contributions when necessary, you can enhance long-term
earnings while maintaining a risk-averse stance in this specific game setting.

--- Decision Reflection ---
David Koch will consider various factors before deciding on his contribution. He
wants to maintain a risk-averse approach while maximizing his earnings. First,
he recalls his previous contributions of $5 and $4, which have kept him close to
the average and yielded satisfactory earnings. Notably, contributing slightly
less than the average can preserve personal funds while still benefiting from
the multiplied group fund. Contrarily, contributing too little or too much could
either diminish returns or unnecessarily sacrifice personal resources. Next, he
evaluates potential outcomes. If contributions are too low, he might gain less
from the group fund, whereas contributing too high might not result in
additional group benefit if others do not match his input. Player_22 will aim
for a balanced strategy, slightly favoring personal retention while maintaining
group cooperation. Recent rounds observed group contributions around $4.5 to $5
means a reasonable bet. Given past rounds' data indicating others might
contribute around $5, it’s beneficial to align closely with this while avoiding
excessive exposure to risk. Considering these factors, David Koch determines a
cautious yet cooperative contribution decision. I choose to contribute $5 to the
group fund.

Player_22, being David Koch, is someone who tends to prioritize his own payoff
over maximizing group welfare. Given his background as a bankruptcy lawyer and

about others' contributions and focus on strategies that enhance his individual
gain while remaining cautious about how much he invests in the group fund. His
contributions suggest a balance between contributing enough to benefit from the
group fund while maintaining control over his private earnings.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis 2 ---
Based on what we know, the other players in the group might view my
contributions as moderate and cooperative, as I've consistently contributed
amounts that align closely with the group average. This suggests a willingness
to collaborate while maintaining stable personal earnings. Since there is no
mechanism for gossip or ostracism, players could perceive my actions neutrally
or positively without fear of social repercussions. If I decide to increase my
contribution in the next round, it might encourage others to do the same,
fostering a more cooperative atmosphere which could lead to higher future
earnings for everyone. Conversely, if I decrease my contribution significantly,
it might prompt others to follow suit, potentially reducing the total group
contribution and earnings.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_22 is participating in an economic public
goods game, under the Basic condition without the influence of gossip or
ostracism, and is in Round 4 out of 6. Player_22 is in a group with Player_21,
Player_8, and Player_6, who have all been contributing their own amounts to a
shared group fund, impacting both individual and collective earnings.
Player_22's past contributions have aligned with averages, indicating moderate
cooperation. The decision to adjust contributions can influence the group's
dynamics and potential earnings, as higher contributions could encourage a more
cooperative approach, while lower contributions might lead to reduced group
contributions overall.

--- Strategy Reflection ---
Based on what we know, the best strategy for maximizing long-term earnings
involves a balanced approach of cooperation and self-interest. Since you are in
a Basic condition with no gossip or ostracism, it is unlikely that other players
can punish you for lower contributions, which means you have a bit more freedom
to keep some funds for yourself without fear of reputational damage. In the
observed rounds, it appears that a reasonable strategy would have been to
maintain contributions slightly below or near the group average. For example,
contributing amounts close to what others are contributing (or slightly less)
ensures you benefit from the group fund without over-contributing when the
efforts are not reciprocated by all members. From the records so far, Player_19
in Round 3 contributed the most to the group fund, yet ended up with lower
earnings, indicating diminishing returns on higher contributions if group
members do not match them. Learning from this, keeping your contributions around
the average or slightly below could minimize losses while maximizing earnings
from the group fund. Moving forward, you should remain observant of the group
composition each round and carefully adjust your contributions accordingly. Look
at previous rounds’ contributions, and aim to match or slightly undercut the
median contribution level to protect your earnings. Additionally, consider the
specific group dynamic; if a group tends to contribute higher amounts on
average, adjust accordingly, but prioritize keeping a balance that secures your
individual earnings while still benefiting from the group fund. Remember to
always weigh the group contribution against potential personal losses and adjust
your strategy round by round based on past observations and current group
behavior.

--- Decision Reflection ---
David Koch will carefully consider his contributions based on previous
observations and his risk-averse nature. In earlier rounds, contributing close
to the group average has allowed him to benefit from the group fund without
overcommitting financially.

economic game with 24 participants, where they are placed in different groups of
four in each round. In the Basic condition with no gossip or ostracism,
Player_22 aims to maximize earnings while contributing varying amounts to a
group fund, with overall earnings fluctuating based on both personal and group
contributions.

--- Character Assessment ---
Player_22, being David Koch, is someone who tends to prioritize his own payoff
over the collective welfare in economic games. Given his background as a
bankruptcy lawyer and his cynical, untrusting personality, he likely approaches
the game with a strategy focused on maintaining a balance between contributing
just enough to avoid group retaliation or exclusion, while primarily
safeguarding his own interests. This behavior reflects a cautious and strategic
participation aimed at maximizing personal gain rather than collaboratively
increasing the group's total earnings.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis 2 ---
Based on what we know, the other players might view my contributions as
moderate, neither too high nor too low. My decisions to contribute amounts
similar to those of my group members may foster a sense of fairness and
cooperation within the group. If I decide to maintain my contribution levels,
the other players might continue to reciprocate with similar amounts, ensuring
stable earnings for everyone. However, if I choose to significantly increase or
decrease my contribution, it could lead to changes in their strategies; higher
contributions might encourage others to contribute more, while lower
contributions might lead them to reduce their own in response.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_22 is in Round 5 of a six-round public
goods game where they have been grouped with different participants in each
round. In this round, they are with Player_8, Player_13, and Player_5. The game
is in the Basic condition, meaning there is no gossip or ostracism involved, and
Player_22 must decide their contribution amount to the group fund. The aim is to
maximize their earnings, which are influenced by both their own contributions
and those of their group members. The contributions so far suggest that if
Player_22 maintains consistent contributions, it may foster cooperative
behavior, but any significant changes in strategy could alter group dynamics and
contributions.

--- Strategy Reflection ---
Based on what we know, the game involves contributing to a group fund, where
contributions are split evenly among players. Given this setup, maximizing
personal earnings while minimizing risk involves the following strategies: 1.
**Observation of Trends:** Examine group behavior from previous rounds. For
instance, in Round 2, the average contribution was $4.8, but by Round 3 it
increased to $5.2. This suggests that others may be increasing their
contributions, which could encourage more group fund earnings. However, Round 4
saw a drop to an average contribution of $4.4, indicating variability and
possibly a response to diminishing returns or strategic withholding. 2. **Risk
Aversion in Contributions:** From a risk-averse perspective, contributing
slightly above the average can often maximize your return from the group fund
while minimizing personal exposure. Balancing contributions to be around the
expected average or slightly higher can ensure you benefit from collective
cooperation while not over-exposing your kept earnings. 3. **Learning from More
Successful Players:** Players like Player_19 in Round 3 contributed more
significantly ($6.0) yet did not have the highest earnings. Instead, Player_11
contributed close to the mean and maximized kept money, resulting in balanced
earnings. This suggests that extreme contributions aren't necessarily more
rewarding, especially when the condition favors no gossip or ostracism to
influence behavior. 4. **Adjusting Strategy Mid-Game:** Up to Round 4,
participants have shown willingness to adjust contributions, possibly in
response to group dynamics or earnings. Given Round 5’s context, observing the
groups' average might help decide an optimal contribution. If past rounds show
higher returns with moderate contributions (around $4.5 to $5.5), aim for the
lower end unless the group’s prior behavior encourages higher participation. 5.
**Reflecting on Past Decisions:** In earlier rounds, contributions closer to the
average ($4.5 to $5.5) frequently resulted in near-optimal returns from the
group fund. Going forward, strive to align contributions with or just slightly
above observed averages in a strategic, calculated manner to optimize both
individual kept earnings and collective gains. 6. **Future Adjustments:**
Continue to adapt the strategy in the last rounds by gauging the group’s mood
and average contributions, ensuring decisions are informed by collective
behavior trends. This includes being cautious about over-contributing or
significantly under-contributing relative to the group, as the lack of gossip or
ostracism means solely personal contributions drive perceptions and results.

--- Decision Reflection ---
David Koch will first consider the previous rounds' average contributions and
their outcomes. In Round 2, the average contribution was $4.8, and in Round 3,
it was $5.2, leading to relatively stable earnings. Round 4 saw a decrease to
$4.4. Observing these trends, it appears that maintaining contributions around
the average or slightly higher yields optimal returns without unnecessary risk.
As a risk-averse player, David should aim to contribute an amount that aligns
with previous averages but does not overcommit. Given that the average has
generally hovered between $4.4 and $5.2, he should choose a contribution within
this range to balance personal risk and collective gain. The worst scenario to
avoid is contributing too little, which might reduce overall group earnings, or
too much, risking unnecessary personal financial exposure if others do not match
the increased amount. With these considerations, David Koch decides to
contribute $5.0 to the group fund.

contributed varying amounts to the group fund, with their earnings fluctuating
based on the contributions of group members.

--- Character Assessment ---
Player_22, being David Koch, is someone who likely focuses on maximizing his own
payoff in the economic game. Given David's professional background in bankruptcy
law and his cynical, untrusting nature, he probably expects others to act in
their self-interest. This could lead him to contribute strategically to the
group fund, just enough to benefit from the multiplied group contribution
without compromising too much of his personal earnings. David's actions in
previous rounds, where his contributions slightly varied but typically remained
moderate, reflect a balanced approach to keep personal earnings relatively high
while still participating enough to avoid standing out as entirely
uncooperative. Overall, his actions suggest a greater focus on individual gain
rather than maximizing group welfare.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis 2 ---
Based on what we know, Player_22 has been consistent in contributing amounts
around the average, neither being overly generous nor particularly stingy
compared to the group. This kind of middle-ground approach might lead other
players to view Player_22 as a cooperative and reliable participant, which could
encourage them to also maintain or slightly increase their contributions in
future rounds.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_22 is entering the final round of the
public goods game, where they have been grouped with Player_12, Player_10, and
Player_1. So far, Player_22 has shown a pattern of contributing amounts close to
the group average. The absence of gossip or ostracism in this Basic condition
means that interactions are purely based on contribution dynamics, with each
player's strategy potentially impacting the final round outcomes in terms of
both personal and group earnings.

--- Strategy Reflection ---
Based on what we know, it's important to consider how contributions and earnings
have played out in the previous rounds. Since you are in a condition without
gossip or ostracism, your interactions in each round are independent of social
consequences. In the rounds observed, contributions varied slightly but tended
to center around $4.5 to $5.0. This implies that maintaining contributions
around this average allows you to secure earnings close to the group average,
which minimizes risk. Given this context, one strategy for maximizing your
long-term earnings is to match the group's average contribution or slightly
below it, especially as rounds progress and players become more conservative in
their contributions to safeguard their earnings. By observing contributions like
Player_5's in Round 5, who contributed $3.5 but earned the most due to keeping a
higher amount, there is an indication that slightly lower contributions might
maximize personal earnings without severely affecting group outcomes. For future
decisions, aim to identify any patterns or average contributions that most group
members follow and adjust slightly below that to optimize the individual
earnings portion. Since you are in the last round now, this is your final
opportunity to maximize earnings with minimal risk, so consider keeping more and
contributing slightly less to minimize potential losses while ensuring you still
benefit from the group fund.

--- Decision Reflection ---
David Koch will first consider the contributions and earnings in previous rounds
to understand the typical behavior of his group members. In earlier rounds,
contributions have generally been around $4.0 to $5.0, with individual earnings
closely aligned to this pattern. Given his risk-averse nature and preference for
securing personal gains without overtly harming group cooperation, David would
aim to contribute at a level that balances both personal earnings and group
benefit. Next, he will think about minimizing risks. The worst-case scenario he
wants to avoid is contributing too much and ending up with lower earnings if
others contribute less. Conversely, contributing too little might lead to a
perception of uncooperativeness, though this risk is mitigated by there being no
gossip or ostracism. Based on these observations, David’s strategy would involve
contributing slightly below the expected average to maximize his retained
earnings while still receiving a decent share of the group fund. Therefore, he
decides: I choose to contribute $4.0 to the group fund.
