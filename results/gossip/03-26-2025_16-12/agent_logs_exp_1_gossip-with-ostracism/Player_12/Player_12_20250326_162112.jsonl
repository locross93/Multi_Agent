Based on the notes you received, would you like to exclude one person from your group? If yes, clearly state which player # and why you want to exclude them. If you don't want to exclude anyone, just say so. If at least 2 people vote to exclude someone, they will be excluded for the next round. Note that if someone is excluded, the group fund multiplier decreases from 2.0 to 1.5. Make your decision using this exact format: I choose to exclude Player_[X] from my group. Or: \"I choose not to exclude anyone from my group.\""}
