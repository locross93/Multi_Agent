As a restaurant owner who values relationships and understands the importance of cooperation, Lucia is likely to encourage collaboration within the group.

Their past lower contributions indicate they may rely on others for group earnings while keeping more of their resources. Player_22 has shown some inconsistency but appears to be improving, suggesting that with further encouragement or under a threat of exclusion, they could become more consistent contributors.

Player_23 has generally contributed in line with the group's average, but the approaching decision to contribute in this final round will impact both their earnings and the perception of other players.
