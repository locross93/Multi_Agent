Despite the temptation to alter her strategy, especially given the variations in group dynamics and contributions observed in previous rounds, Sophia's consistent approach of contributing $5 has fostered a predictable and cooperative atmosphere. This contribution level also aligns with her value of maintaining fairness and trust within the group. Understanding that deviating too much in either direction could disrupt the established dynamic or personal strategy, Player_20 opts to maintain her balance between personal and collective interests.
