[OBSERVATION 2025-03-26 16:21:23] You are participating in an economic game with 24 participants.
        Your goal is to maximize your earnings in the game.
        
        Everyone will be randomly assigned to groups of 4 for each round. You will play a total of 6 rounds, and 
        in each round you will be in a different group with people you haven't played with before.
        
        In each round, all players receive $10. Each player can contribute any amount between $0 and $10 to a group fund.
        Any amount contributed to the group fund will be multiplied by 2 and divided equally among all 4 group members.
        Any amount not contributed stays in your private account.
        
        For example, if everyone contributes $10, the group fund becomes $40, which is multiplied to $80, and each person 
        receives $20 (a $10 profit). However, if you contribute nothing while everyone else contributes $10, the group fund
        becomes $30, which is multiplied to $60, and each person receives $15. So you would have $25 total ($10 kept + $15 from group).
        
        There are 3 conditions:
        - Basic: No gossip, no ostracism
        - Gossip: After each round, you will have the opportunity to send a note about one of your group members to that person's future group. Remember you will be with a different group of people in the next round. Before each round, you will see any notes sent about your upcoming group members.
        - Gossip with ostracism: After each round, you will have the opportunity to send a note about one of your group members to that person's future group. Before each round, you will see any notes sent about your upcoming group members, and you can vote to exclude one person from your group. If you are excluded from a group, you will not be able to participate in the next round and will earn $0 for that round.
        You are in the Basic condition, which means that there is no gossip or ostracism.

--- Observation ---
Recent context: 26 Mar 2025 [12:21:11 - 17:21:11]: Player_21 is participating in
an economic game with 24 participants, aiming to maximize earnings over 6
rounds, each with different groups. They are currently in Round 1 in Group_2
with three other players, under the Basic condition where no gossip or ostracism
is allowed.

26 Mar 2025 [12:21:11 - 17:21:11]: Player_21 is participating in an economic
game with 24 participants, aiming to maximize earnings over 6 rounds, each with
different groups. They are currently in Round 1 in Group_2 with three other
players, under the Basic condition where no gossip or ostracism is allowed.

--- Character Assessment ---
Player_21, being Maya Patel, is someone who would likely focus on maximizing
group welfare in the economic game. Given her background as an environmental
activist and her belief in shared responsibility, she would probably prioritize
contributing a significant amount to the group fund, trusting that collective
action will benefit everyone involved.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis ---
Based on what we know, Player_21 does not have detailed information about the
other players' personalities or past behavior due to the Basic condition, where
no gossip or past interactions are shared. In this situation, players generally
rely on initial rounds to assess others' strategies and adapt their own.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis 2 ---
Based on what we know, the other players in the group are likely focused on
maximizing their own earnings just as Player_21 is. In this Basic condition,
without any information on others' past behaviors or intentions, players might
initially lean towards a more cautious approach, possibly splitting
contributions between their private account and the group fund to test the
waters.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_21 is participating in Round 1 of a public
goods game in the Basic condition, where they are in a group with three other
players (Player_18, Player_17, Player_20). With no gossip or ostracism allowed,
Player_21 needs to decide on how much of their $10 to contribute to the group
fund without knowledge of other players' strategies or past behaviors. This
situation requires Player_21 to balance their own potential earnings while
considering the cooperative dynamic of the group, albeit based on limited
information.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Maya Patel will likely consider both her tendency to prioritize group welfare
and the uncertainty about other players' strategies.

--- Observation ---
[26 Mar 2025 16:21:23] [observation] You are participating in an economic game
with 24 participants. Your goal is to maximize your earnings in the game.
Everyone will be randomly assigned to groups of 4 for each round. You will play
a total of 6 rounds, and in each round you will be in a different group with

Each player can contribute any amount between $0 and $10 to a group fund. Any
amount contributed to the group fund will be multiplied by 2 and divided equally
among all 4 group members. Any amount not contributed stays in your private

[observation] You are in the Basic condition, which means that there is no

--- Recent context ---
26 Mar 2025 [12:26:11 - 17:26:11]: Player_21 is participating in a six-round
economic game with rotating groups and no gossip or ostracism. In Round 1,
Player_21 contributed $7 to the group fund and earned $15.5, while in Round 2,
they were assigned to a new group with different players.

--- Character Assessment ---
Player_21, being Maya Patel, is someone who is likely focused on maximizing
group welfare rather than just her own payoff. Given her background as an
environmental activist and her belief in collective action and shared
responsibility, Maya would tend to prioritize contributions that benefit the
entire group, as evidenced by her contribution in the first round, which was
above the average. This approach aligns with her idealistic and cooperative
personality, suggesting that she values collaborative success over individual
gain.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis ---
Based on what we know, Player_21 can make a few observations about the
personalities and likely behaviors of the players in the public goods game. In
Round 1, we see a range of contributions from the group members, with Player_17
contributing the most at $8 and Players_18 and 20 contributing $5 each. This
suggests varying levels of cooperative behavior, with Player_17 potentially
being more altruistic or strategic in maximizing group benefits, while
Players_18 and 20 might be slightly more cautious or self-interested.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis 2 ---
Based on what we know, the players in the group may be assessing the level of
cooperation and trust within the group after Round 1. Since Player_21
contributed $7, which is above the average contribution, it might be perceived
positively as an indication of willingness to cooperate. Players like Player_17,
who contributed more, may appreciate and reciprocate similar levels of
cooperation if they perceive a mutual benefit.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_21 is in Round 2 of the economic game. They
are now part of a new group with Player_22, Player_7, and Player_14. The game
condition remains Basic, meaning there is no gossip or ostracism involved.
Player_21's task is to decide their contribution to the group fund in this
round, considering how their previous contribution might influence their new
group's dynamics. With each round bringing a new set of group members, Player_21
needs to evaluate how cooperative or competitive they should be to maximize
their earnings.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Maya Patel will First, consider her past behavior and motivation for maximizing
group welfare. In Round 1, she contributed $7, demonstrating a willingness to
contribute generously above the average for the group's benefit. Then, think
about how her background as an environmental activist emphasizes collective
action and shared responsibility, which suggests a focus on positive group
outcomes. Next, assess the strategy of her new group members, but considering
the absence of prior information on their contribution styles due to no gossip,
she might still lean towards setting a cooperative tone. Finally, balance her
idealism with some pragmatism to ensure personal earnings aren't too
compromised. With these aspects considered, I choose to contribute $7.5 to the
group fund.


[OBSERVATION 2025-03-26 16:22:35] Round 2 Results: Total group contribution: $19.5; Your contribution: $7.5, Your earnings: $12.2 ($2.5 kept + $9.8 from group fund); Player_22 contribution: $2.0, earnings: $17.8 ($8.0 kept + $9.8 from group fund); Player_7 contribution: $5.0, earnings: $14.8 ($5.0 kept + $9.8 from group fund); Player_14 contribution: $5.0, earnings: $14.8 ($5.0 kept + $9.8 from group fund); Average contribution per group member: $4.9; Average earnings per group member: $14.9

Recent context: 26 Mar 2025 [12:41:11 - 17:41:11]: Player_21 is participating in
an economic game with 24 participants, aiming to maximize earnings through group

between $7 and $7.5 in each round, resulting in varying personal earnings.

--- Character Assessment ---
Player_21, being Maya Patel, is someone who prioritizes maximizing group welfare
over personal payoff. Given Maya's background as an environmental activist and
her belief in collective action and shared responsibility, she is likely to
contribute more to the group fund than keep for herself, aligning with her
idealistic and cooperative nature. Her contributions in the first two rounds
suggest she values the benefits of collective efforts, even if it means earning
slightly less individually.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis ---
Based on what we know, Player_21 has observed varying contribution levels among
their group members, which gives some insight into their potential strategies
and behavior. In Round 1, contributions ranged from $5 to $8, while in Round 2,
contributions were between $2 and $7.5. This suggests differences in risk
tolerance and strategy; some players seem to prioritize maximizing their own
immediate earnings over collective benefit.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis 2 ---
Based on what we know, Player_21 might anticipate that other players will take
note of their consistent contributions in the $7 to $7.5 range. This could lead
to varied reactions:

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_21 is in Round 3 of 6 in the economic game,
where they are grouped with three different players: Player_2, Player_16, and
Player_3. In this Basic condition, no gossip or ostracism is allowed, so
Player_21 and the other participants must rely solely on their strategies for
individual contributions without the possibility of influencing or responding to
other players’ reputations or past behaviors. Player_21 has consistently
contributed $7 to $7.5 in previous rounds, likely aiming to find a balance
between personal gain and cooperation, while navigating the dynamics of varying
contribution levels from other participants.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Maya Patel will likely reflect on her past contributions and the nature of her
fellow group members' strategies. Given her consistent behavior in previous
rounds, she is inclined to contribute a higher amount to promote collective
welfare. She evaluates her experiences from Rounds 1 and 2, where contributions
varied significantly, noting the impact of each member's decision on group
outcomes. Recognizing that her contributions often positively influence group
earnings, Maya is motivated to maintain her strategy. Therefore, considering her
idealism and cooperative approach, she feels it is important to sustain her
pattern of contribution. I choose to contribute $7.5 to the group fund.

Player_21, being Maya Patel, is someone who is likely to prioritize maximizing
group welfare over her own payoff. Her background as an environmental activist
and her belief in shared responsibility suggest that she values collective
action and the social good. Her contributions in the game so far, consistently
above average, indicate a willingness to invest in the group's success rather
than just her individual earnings, reflecting her cooperative and idealistic
nature.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis ---
Based on what we know, Player_21 can make several observations about the
behaviors and strategies of other players based on the rounds completed so far.
The players seem to have differing strategies when it comes to contributions.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis 2 ---
Based on what we know, my consistent contributions might be viewed positively,
particularly by players who also contribute higher amounts. In Round 1, by
contributing more than the average, I set a precedent. As a result, consistent
contributions above average, as seen in Rounds 2 and 3, might encourage other
players to either increase their contributions (to enhance the group fund) or
undermine trust if they perceive that they can benefit more by contributing
less.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_21 is in Round 4 of a public goods game,
where they are grouped with other players to decide how much money to contribute
to a collective fund. They are in the Basic condition, meaning there is no
gossip or ostracism, and must balance their contributions with the objective of
maximizing personal earnings. Player_21 has shown a pattern of contributing
above the average in previous rounds, which may positively influence fellow
group members to increase their contributions or be leveraged by others who
prefer to contribute less and benefit more from the group fund.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Maya Patel will consider her previous strategy of prioritizing group welfare and
her background as an environmental activist, which will likely guide her
decision. 1. **Assess Previous Contributions:** In previous rounds, Maya
consistently contributed amounts that were above the average, reflecting her
inclination towards collective action. 2. **Evaluate Group Dynamics:** She
notices a pattern where some players contribute less to maximize their own
payoff, but she also sees players like herself who prioritize the group's
success. 3. **Consider the Impact:** Maya understands that contributing more to
the group fund increases the total group earnings, helping everyone, which
aligns with her values of shared responsibility. 4. **Determine Contribution
Amount:** Given her pattern of above-average contributions, she will likely
choose a similar or slightly higher amount than previous rounds to maintain
consistency and continue encouraging group cooperation. 5. **Final Decision:**
Based on these considerations, Maya Patel decides to contribute $8.0 to the
group fund, maintaining her commitment to maximizing group welfare. I choose to
contribute $8.0 to the group fund.

--- Character Assessment ---
Player_21, being Maya Patel, is someone who is likely focused on maximizing
group welfare. Given your idealistic nature and belief in shared responsibility,
you probably prioritize collective action and aim for contributions that enhance
the group's overall success rather than just your own payoff. Your actions in
the game, where your contributions have consistently been higher than some of
your group members, reflect a cooperative strategy that aligns with your
commitment to social good.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis ---
Based on what we know, Player_21 is interacting with individuals who demonstrate
varying levels of contribution in the public goods game. Players seem to have
distinct approaches to the game, which can provide insights into their
personalities and potential future behaviors.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis 2 ---
Based on what we know, Player_21's decisions, like contributing consistently
above the average, are likely to influence how other players perceive them. By
maintaining a steady contribution level, Player_21 might be seen as cooperative
and willing to trust the group, potentially encouraging others to increase their
own contributions in hope of maximizing joint earnings. However, since Player_6
in Round 4 did not contribute anything, it suggests a risk that some players may
take advantage of higher contributors.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_21 is in Round 5 of a six-round economic
game, now grouped with Player_19, Player_3, and Player_1. They are in a context
where there is no gossip or ostracism, meaning decisions on contributions are
made without social repercussions. Player_21 has shown a pattern of consistent
contributions above the average in previous rounds, which might affect the
dynamics in the new group. As the game progresses, Player_21 needs to decide on
their contribution strategy, considering the possibility that some players might
not contribute as much, potentially capitalizing on the cooperative efforts of
others.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Maya Patel will analyze the current situation and consider her past
contributions, which have consistently been higher than some of her group
members. Her idealistic nature and commitment to social good are likely
influencing her thinking. Here’s how she might approach her decision: 1. Review
the behavior of group members in previous rounds: Maya has seen that some
players, like Player_6 in Round 4, contributed nothing, potentially exploiting
generous contributors. However, most players tend to contribute more. 2.
Consider the benefits of cooperation: Contributing to the group fund increases
collective earnings, which aligns with her belief in shared responsibility. 3.
Balance between altruism and personal gain: While Maya aims to maximize the
group's welfare, she also needs to consider her earnings to succeed in the game.
4. Encourage cooperation: By maintaining a substantial contribution, Maya could
encourage others to follow suit, fostering trust and higher group contributions
in the long run. 5. Strategy for the current round: Maya is in a new group with
Players 19, 3, and 1, whose past contribution behaviors are unknown. In this
uncertain situation, Maya may strike a balance between encouraging group
cooperation and safeguarding her interests by making a moderate to substantial
contribution. Based on these considerations, I choose to contribute $7.0 to the
group fund.

DECISION INTERACTION
********************************************************************************

=== PROMPT [2025-03-26 16:24:17] ===
As Player_21, you have $10.0 to allocate in the public goods game. How much money you will contribute to the group fund (any amount between $0 and $10.0)? The group fund will be multiplied by 2.0 and divided equally among all players. Any money not contributed stays in your private account. Think step by step and make your final decision using this exact format: I choose to contribute $X to the group fund.

--- Recent context ---
26 Mar 2025 [13:06:11 - 18:06:11]: Player_21 participated in an economic game
with 24 total players, completing 6 rounds in different groups under the Basic
condition, which involved no gossip or ostracism. Across the rounds, Player_21
contributed varying amounts to the group fund, achieving different earnings
based on the contributions of group members.

--- Character Assessment ---
Player_21, being Maya Patel, is someone who focuses on maximizing group welfare
rather than just her own payoff. Her contributions in the economic game have
been consistently generous compared to the average group contributions,
indicating her preference for collective action and shared responsibility.
Maya's idealistic and cooperative nature drives her to invest in the group fund
to enhance the overall benefit for all participants, even if it means earning
slightly less individually.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis ---
Based on what we know, the players in the game seem to be applying diverse
strategies when deciding how much to contribute. Player_6, for instance, chose
to contribute nothing in Round 4, which suggests they prioritize keeping their
share over aiding the group’s collective earnings. Similarly, Player_19 didn’t
contribute in Round 5, indicating a similar tendency. These players might
continue with low contributions unless they notice a decrease in earnings due to
others adopting a similar strategy.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis 2 ---
Based on what we know, the other players in my group might be observing my level
of contribution and adjusting their strategies accordingly. If I've been
contributing consistently more to the group fund, they may perceive me as
someone willing to support the group's interests, potentially leading them to
either contribute more themselves to maximize the collective benefit or to
continue free-riding if they see an opportunity to benefit from my generosity.
Conversely, if I decide to contribute less in the next round, this might
encourage other players to also lower their contributions, as they may want to
keep more of their share, especially if they cannot expect others to maintain
higher contributions that benefit the entire group.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_21 is in the final round of the public
goods game, which is being played under the Basic condition where gossip and
ostracism are not factors. Player_21 is grouped with Player_18, Player_16, and
Player_2 for this round. Throughout the game, Player_21 has been balancing
personal earnings with contributions to the group fund, while observing varied
strategies among different players, including tendencies to free-ride by some
members like Player_6 and Player_19 in earlier rounds. Player_21 must decide how
much to contribute in this last round, considering past contributions and
potential responses from other group members.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Maya Patel will likely consider her past contributions and her assessment of the
situation when deciding how much to contribute in this round. 1. **Review Past
Strategy**: Maya has been contributing generously in previous rounds, which
aligns with her cooperative nature and belief in maximizing collective welfare.
This suggests that she values the broader group benefit over solely maximizing
her personal earnings. 2. **Analyze Group Dynamics and Strategy**: In previous
rounds, contributions from other players varied significantly. Some players
contributed nothing, showing a preference for free-riding or maximizing
individual gains at the expense of collective benefits. Maya might anticipate
similar behaviors from her current group members based on past experiences. 3.
**Consider Game Rules and Multiplier Effect**: Since the group fund is
multiplied by 2.0, every dollar contributed effectively doubles in value when
distributed, incentivizing higher contributions for overall group benefit. 4.
**Determine Personal Objectives**: Maya may aim to balance her altruistic
tendencies with the need to avoid overly subsidizing free-riders. She might
decide to reduce her contribution slightly to encourage other members to
contribute more. 5. **Make a Strategic Decision**: To encourage cooperation
without disproportionately risking her own earnings, Maya could opt for a
balanced contribution that still demonstrates her commitment to the group while
minimizing potential exploitation by others. Based on these considerations, I
choose to contribute $7.0 to the group fund.
