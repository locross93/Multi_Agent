With a strong belief in collective action and shared responsibility, Maya consistently contributes generously to the group fund, demonstrating her commitment to cooperation and mutual benefit. Her idealistic nature and passion for social good drive her to engage in strategies that enhance overall group success and build trust among participants.", "", "Theory of Mind Analysis: Based on what we know, Player_10 appears to be consistently generous and cooperative, likely to continue supporting the group fund vigorously. This reliable behavior suggests they value mutual success and are motivated by collective benefits, fostering trust within the group. Moving forward, Player_10 might maintain or even increase their contributions to emphasize their commitment to group success.", "", "Theory of Mind Analysis 2: Based on what we know, the other players might view my balanced approach to contributions favorably, as I aim to support both individual and collective benefits.

In the Gossip condition, Player_21 can give and receive feedback about other players without the threat of being ostracized, impacting group dynamics in future rounds. Player_21 needs to consider how their moderate contributions influence others, especially in light of the varying strategies and behaviors exhibited by other players like Player_10, who is cooperative, and Player_4 and Player_12, who are more self-interested.
