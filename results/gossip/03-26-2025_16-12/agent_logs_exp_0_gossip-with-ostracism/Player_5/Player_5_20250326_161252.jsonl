Drawing on poker skills and a keen ability to read others, Victor is likely to assess each player's tendencies and motivations to inform his approach. While primarily focused on maximizing his own payoff, he will support group welfare when it aligns with his interests or when it can be leveraged to build trust for future advantage.

Player_5 can also choose to send a gossip note about one of their previous group members, which will influence that player's future interactions.
