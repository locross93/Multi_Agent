If you don't want to exclude anyone, just say so. If at least 2 people vote to exclude someone, they will be excluded for the next round. Note that if someone is excluded, the group fund multiplier decreases from 2.0 to 1.5. Make your decision using this exact format: I choose to exclude Player_[X] from my group. Or: \"I choose not to exclude anyone from my group.\"", "Answer: Player_3 chooses to exclude Player_19 from their group. Despite the decrease in the group fund multiplier, Player_19's history of contributing below the group average and prioritizing individual gain over collective success undermines the group's efforts to foster cooperation and enhance overall outcomes. Excluding them aligns with Player_3\u2019s strategic approach to encourage a more collaborative and productive group dynamic."]}

Their consistent underperformance relative to the group's average likely indicates a strategy focused on personal earnings, which led to their exclusion in round 5. Given the gossip with ostracism condition, Player_19 might be forced to reconsider their approach if they wish to remain in the game and avoid further exclusions.

Such a decision could build trust and solidify alliances with those who prioritize group success.
