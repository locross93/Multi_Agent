The other players might appreciate the contribution as it benefits the group fund, but since there's no gossip or ostracism, they cannot influence Player_13's behavior directly or express dissatisfaction effectively. If Player_13 continues to contribute steadily, it may encourage others who are also regular contributors, like Player_7 and Player_24, to maintain their contributions.
