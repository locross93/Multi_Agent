Given Player_20's context, they've seen firsthand the impact of being ostracized. To enhance earnings, they should aim to contribute slightly below the average contribution to maximize retained earnings while still appearing cooperative. Observing players like Player_13 and Player_14, who contribute above average and foster trust within the group, is insightful. Emulating their consistency in contribution without matching exactly their levels can be beneficial. ", "", "In the past rounds, Player_20 might have minimized their exposure to exclusion by contributing a bit more than $6.5, aligning closer to the group average ($7.1) to blend in better. Going forward, it's advantageous to refrain from sending potentially damaging gossip notes, as strong performers tend to avoid sowing distrust within the group. Being less cooperative in terms of shared trust-building, but strategically cooperative in contribution levels, would help balance personal earnings while maintaining a good standing within the group. In short, focus on subtle alignment with group norms while selfishly ensuring retained earnings exceed average contributions.", "", "Decision Reflection: Claire Dubois will choose not to exclude anyone from the group.", "", "Exercise: You are about to play with Player_14, Player_1, Player_9.
