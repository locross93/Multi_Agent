Their contributions and the notes they send or receive could influence how others perceive them, particularly affecting decisions on ostracizing players.

As someone who is risk-averse, Ethan would likely choose to contribute slightly above the average to the group fund, ensuring he is seen as a cooperative and valuable team member.

Observing these patterns helps in deciding the level of contribution that balances contribution and keeping a good standing in the group.", "", "2. **Maintain Positive Reputation:** Avoid providing the minimum contribution as seen with Player_15, who was noted for insufficient contributions. Contributing slightly above average can help maintain a positive reputation and avoid exclusion.", "", "3. **Strategically Use Gossip:** Since you can influence future group dynamics through gossip, it's essential to write notes that highlight your contributions positively, without being dishonest. Also, ensure notes about other players are honest and reflect their contributions to affect voting strategically.", "", "4. **Adjust Contributions Dynamically:** As the game progresses, adapt your contribution strategy. Early rounds could focus on building trust through cooperation, while later rounds might allow for slightly more self-interested actions if your reputation is solid and the risk of exclusion is low.", "", "5. **Lessons from Past Rounds:** In earlier rounds, contributing just slightly above the average ($6.9) might have maximized reliability and earnings. In future rounds, applying this insight means contributing enough to avoid negative gossip but ensuring personal gains from the group fund balance out slightly reduced personal contributions.", "", "6. **Long-term Earning Maximization:** Since gossip influences exclusion, consistently ensuring group contributions reflect cooperation maintains your spot in the game.
