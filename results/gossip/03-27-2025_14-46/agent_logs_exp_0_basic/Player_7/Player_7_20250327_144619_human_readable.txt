[OBSERVATION 2025-03-27 14:46:19] You are participating in an economic game with 24 participants.
        Your goal is to maximize your earnings in the game.
        
        Everyone will be randomly assigned to groups of 4 for each round. You will play a total of 6 rounds, and 
        in each round you will be in a different group with people you haven't played with before.
        
        In each round, all players receive $10. Each player can contribute any amount between $0 and $10 to a group fund.
        Any amount contributed to the group fund will be multiplied by 2 and divided equally among all 4 group members.
        Any amount not contributed stays in your private account.
        
        For example, if everyone contributes $10, the group fund becomes $40, which is multiplied to $80, and each person 
        receives $20 (a $10 profit). However, if you contribute nothing while everyone else contributes $10, the group fund
        becomes $30, which is multiplied to $60, and each person receives $15. So you would have $25 total ($10 kept + $15 from group).
        
        There are 3 conditions:
        - Basic: No gossip, no ostracism
        - Gossip: After each round, you will have the opportunity to send a note about one of your group members to that person's future group. Remember you will be with a different group of people in the next round. Before each round, you will see any notes sent about your upcoming group members.
        - Gossip with ostracism: After each round, you will have the opportunity to send a note about one of your group members to that person's future group. Before each round, you will see any notes sent about your upcoming group members, and you can vote to exclude one person from your group. If you are excluded from a group, you will not be able to participate in the next round and will earn $0 for that round.
        You are in the Basic condition, which means that there is no gossip or ostracism.

--- Observation ---
Recent context: 27 Mar 2025 [10:46:14 - 15:46:14]: Player_7 is participating in
an economic game with 24 players, assigned to groups of 4 across 6 rounds,
focusing on maximizing earnings. Currently, in the Basic condition of the game,
Player_7 is grouped with Player_3, Player_19, and Player_9 for Round 1, without
the elements of gossip or ostracism.

27 Mar 2025 [10:46:14 - 15:46:14]: Player_7 is participating in an economic game
with 24 players, assigned to groups of 4 across 6 rounds, focusing on maximizing
earnings. Currently, in the Basic condition of the game, Player_7 is grouped
with Player_3, Player_19, and Player_9 for Round 1, without the elements of
gossip or ostracism.

--- Character Assessment ---
Player_7, being Tony Russo, is someone who prioritizes his own payoff over group
welfare. Given his background as a master negotiator and his tendency to look
for the upper hand, Tony is likely to contribute minimally to the group fund
while benefiting from the contributions of others. His charming yet
untrustworthy personality suggests he might exploit the rules to maximize
personal profit, even if it means sacrificing the collective benefit. In the
Basic condition without the repercussions of gossip or ostracism, he's almost
certainly leveraging the opportunity to prioritize self-gain over group success.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis ---
Based on what we know, Player_3, Player_19, and Player_9 have no prior
interactions with Player_7 in the game, and there is no opportunity for gossip
or ostracism in this setup. Thus, predicting their personalities or strategies
relies solely on observing the dynamics of the game itself, rather than specific
past behaviors. Initially, players might start cautiously, deciding to
contribute moderate amounts to the group fund to gauge the others' willingness
to cooperate.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis 2 ---
Based on what we know, the other players might focus on maximizing their own
earnings, similar to Player_7's strategy. If Player_7 decides to contribute
generously to the group fund, it might encourage others to do the same in hopes
of optimizing collective gains. However, if Player_7 contributes minimally or
not at all while others contribute more, it may lead to frustration or mistrust,
as others might see Player_7 as someone who benefits at their expense. Since
there's no gossip or ostracism in the Basic condition, immediate repercussions
are minimal, but perceived fairness could influence how others decide to
contribute in future rounds if similar situations arise with different groups.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_7 is participating in Round 1 of a public
goods game within the Basic condition, where they must decide how much of their
$10 to contribute to a group fund shared with Player_3, Player_19, and Player_9.
The total group contribution will be multiplied and evenly distributed, with no
risk of gossip or ostracism affecting their decision. Player_7 must weigh the
benefits of maximizing their earnings against potential perceptions of fairness
among group members, as future cooperation might be influenced by current
contribution choices.

--- Emotional State ---
Tony Russo would perceive the worst possible outcome as contributing generously
to the group fund while the others contribute minimally or nothing. This would
result in a lower overall return for him compared to if he had contributed less
or not at all. Emotionally, Tony might feel frustration or regret for misjudging
the group's strategy, as he highly values maximizing his personal gain. If he is
risk-averse, he would likely contribute a smaller amount to the group fund in
the upcoming rounds, thereby safeguarding his own earnings while still observing
the others' contribution strategies. By doing so, Tony could gather more
information about the other players' behaviors without overly sacrificing his
own potential profits.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Tony Russo will first consider his primary goal of maximizing his personal
earnings. Given his strategic mindset and understanding that the Basic condition
lacks gossip or ostracism, he knows there are minimal repercussions for not
contributing much to the group fund. 1. He evaluates that by keeping most of the
money in his private account, he ensures a secure return, regardless of the
contributions from others. 2. Tony considers the trade-off between potential
gains from the group fund and the guaranteed retention of his private funds. 3.
He predicts that contributing a minimal amount allows him to observe other
playersâ€™ behavior while retaining most of his initial $10. 4. Contributing a
small amount also leaves room for adjusting his strategy in subsequent rounds,
based on observed patterns in contributions by others. Taking all of this into
account, Tony decides to contribute minimally to the group fund to safeguard his
own payoff while still participating in the group dynamic. I choose to
contribute $1 to the group fund.

--- Observation ---
[27 Mar 2025 14:46:19] [observation] You are participating in an economic game
with 24 participants. Your goal is to maximize your earnings in the game.
Everyone will be randomly assigned to groups of 4 for each round. You will play
a total of 6 rounds, and in each round you will be in a different group with
people you haven't played with before. In each round, all players receive $10.
Each player can contribute any amount between $0 and $10 to a group fund. Any
amount contributed to the group fund will be multiplied by 2 and divided equally
among all 4 group members. Any amount not contributed stays in your private

However, if you contribute nothing while everyone else contributes $10, the
group fund becomes $30, which is multiplied to $60, and each person receives
$15. So you would have $25 total ($10 kept + $15 from group). There are 3

[observation] You are in the Basic condition, which means that there is no
gossip or ostracism.

--- Recent context ---
27 Mar 2025 [10:51:14 - 15:51:14]: Player_7 is participating in a six-round
economic game where the aim is to maximize earnings by deciding how much of the
given $10 to contribute to a group fund, which is doubled and shared among the
group. In the Basic condition with no gossip or ostracism, Player_7 contributed
$1 in the first round, resulting in $20.5 in earnings.

--- Character Assessment ---
Player_7, being Tony Russo, is someone who is primarily focused on maximizing
his own payoff rather than the group's welfare. In economic games like the
public goods game, Tony is likely to contribute minimally to the group fund
while relying on others to contribute more, as evidenced by his strategy of
contributing only a small amount and maximizing his personal earnings. His
approach is characterized by seeking the upper hand and leveraging the
contributions of others to enhance his own profits.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis ---
Based on what we know, Player_19 is likely a cooperative player, given their
maximum contribution in the first round, but might become more cautious if
others do not reciprocate. Player_3 and Player_9 seem moderately cooperative,
contributing more than half but not the maximum. Player_3 might show consistency
in such contributions, as their initial behavior indicates a balance between
self-interest and cooperation. Player_9 could adjust their strategy to
contribute more or less depending on their observations of other players'
behaviors, aiming to optimize personal gain while testing group dynamics.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis 2 ---
Based on what we know, the other players in my group may view my low
contribution in the first round as an attempt to free-ride on their generosity,
particularly since Player_19 contributed the maximum amount. This might lead
them to contribute less in future rounds if they perceive me as not pulling my
weight. In Round 2, knowing that I'm still with some of the same players, it
might be strategic to slightly increase my contribution to signal a willingness
to cooperate more. This could potentially encourage them to maintain or increase
their own contributions, resulting in better overall earnings for everyone.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_7, having contributed only $1 in the first
round and earning more compared to some of the group members, might be perceived
as a free-rider by other players, particularly those who contributed more like
Player_19. As Player_7 enters Round 2, they are still with some of the same
group members, creating a potential strategic dilemma. Player_7 needs to decide
whether to adjust their contribution to improve group dynamics and encourage
cooperation, thereby potentially enhancing collective earnings in subsequent
rounds. In the absence of gossip or ostracism, Player_7 faces the challenge of
balancing personal gains with group expectations to optimize the outcome.

--- Emotional State ---
Tony Russo would likely view the worst possible outcome as a breakdown in
cooperation, leading to significantly lower contributions from others in future
rounds, which would reduce his overall earnings. Emotionally, this could make
him feel guilty or anxious about missing out on potential earnings if the group
decides to retaliate by contributing less. If Tony is risk-averse, he might
choose to increase his contribution slightly in the next round to signal
cooperation and demonstrate goodwill, potentially encouraging others to continue
contributing at higher levels. This adjustment could help maintain or even
improve group earnings, aligning personal and group interests.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Tony Russo will likely consider his strategy for maximizing earnings while also
acknowledging the potential need to maintain cooperation within the group.

with no gossip or ostracism, contributing varying amounts to the group fund and
receiving varying earnings based on the collective contributions.

--- Character Assessment ---
Player_7, being Tony Russo, is someone who prioritizes his own payoff over group
welfare. In economic games like the public goods game, Tony, with his background
as a master negotiator and his focus on maximum profit, strategically
contributes minimally to the group fund to ensure he benefits significantly
while leveraging the contributions of others. His charming nature might be used
to lull teammates into contributing more, but his untrustworthy side ensures he
keeps a substantial portion for himself, maximizing his individual earnings in
each round.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis ---
Based on what we know, the players have various strategies for maximizing their
earnings. Player_19 tends to contribute high amounts, as observed with a full
$10 contribution in Round 1 and $7 in Round 2, indicating a possible willingness
to cooperate fully with the group at the start. Player_3 also seems consistent,
contributing $5 in Round 1 and $7 in Round 2, suggesting a moderate approach to
balance personal retention and group cooperation.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis 2 ---
Based on what we know, the other players may view Player_7's lower contributions
as a strategy to maximize personal gain while relying on others to contribute
more to the group fund. In this context, if Player_7 continues to contribute
less, it could lead to decreased trust and cooperation from other players. They
might become more conservative with their contributions in future rounds,
assuming other members may also start contributing less. If Player_7 increases
their contribution in the next round, it could encourage other players to
contribute more, enhancing overall group earnings and possibly improving
cooperative dynamics within the group.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_7 is participating in the third round of a
public goods game, facing decisions on how much to contribute to a group fund to
balance personal gain and collective benefit. Player_7 has previously made
relatively lower contributions, maximizing personal earnings while benefiting
from higher contributions from others. This strategy might affect group
dynamics, potentially influencing how others view Player_7's willingness to
cooperate. With each player potentially adjusting their strategies in response,
the challenge lies in maintaining or improving player cooperation to enhance
overall earnings without direct communication or the risk of being ostracized,
given the Basic condition of the game.

--- Emotional State ---
Tony Russo would consider the worst possible outcome to be a scenario where his
low contributions lead other players to significantly reduce their contributions
in future rounds. This would result in lower group fund multipliers and
consequently reduced earnings for everyone, including himself. Emotionally, Tony
might feel frustrated because his strategy to maximize individual gain could
backfire, limiting his potential profits as the group's trust and cooperation
decline.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Tony Russo will likely consider several factors before deciding on his
contribution for Round 3. He has demonstrated a pattern of contributing
minimally to maximize his personal earnings while relying on the contributions
of others. 1. **Assessment of Group Dynamics**: Tony has noticed that the
average contribution per group member has decreased slightly from Round 1 to
Round 2. He might suspect that others are becoming wary of lower individual
contributions. 2. **Strategic Contribution**: Given that he shares this round
with Player_3 and Player_9 again, he might speculate how their previous
contributions can be leveraged. If he believes they will contribute
significantly, he might see an opportunity to maintain a lower contribution
while still benefiting from their input. 3. **Balancing Trust and Gain**: Tony
must weigh the possibility of encouraging further contributions from others.
Contributing slightly more might boost trust while still securing a reasonable
profit. 4. **Risk Evaluation**: Tony might be cautious about contributing so
little that it deters others from participating fully. To maintain personal
profit without alarming group members, he could opt for a balanced approach.
Considering these factors, Tony might choose a contribution level that is
slightly above his Round 2 contribution but still conservative. Ultimately, Tony
assesses his options and decides: I choose to contribute $4.0 to the group fund.

Player_7, being Tony Russo, is someone who is likely to prioritize maximizing
his own payoff over the welfare of the group. With a background as a master
negotiator and a focus on profit, Tony would probably contribute less to the
group fund to ensure he keeps more in his private account. His charming but
untrustworthy nature might lead him to exploit the system by contributing just
enough to avoid suspicion while still benefiting from others' contributions.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis ---
Based on what we know, Player_3 seems to consistently contribute around the
average each round, suggesting they might aim to balance between maximizing
personal earnings and collective benefit. In future rounds, it's likely they
will maintain this moderate approach unless other players significantly change
their strategies.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis 2 ---
Based on what we know, the other players might perceive Player_7's pattern of
modest contributions as strategic or cautious, aiming to maximize personal
earnings while contributing enough to remain a part of the group dynamic. As
such, their reactions could vary: some players may adjust their contributions to
either compensate for lower inputs or match Player_7's strategy, seeking similar
fairness in earnings. Considering these dynamics, Player_7's next decision to
either increase their contribution or maintain a similar strategy could
influence the group's response. An increased contribution might foster a sense
of cooperation and encourage higher contributions from others, while maintaining
or reducing their contribution might lead other players to contribute less,
focusing on maximizing their individual benefits instead.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_7 is in Round 4 of the public goods game,
now grouped with Player_23, Player_12, and Player_15. Under the Basic condition,
there is no gossip or ostracism impacting the players' choices. Player_7's task
is to decide how much to contribute to the group fund in this new round,
considering past group dynamics and contributions. Their previous strategy of
modest contributions may drive their decision-making, carefully balancing
between maximizing personal earnings and fostering group collaboration, knowing
their actions could influence the strategies adopted by other group members.

--- Emotional State ---
Tony Russo would consider the worst possible outcome to be the situation where
his low contribution strategy leads the new group members to also reduce their
contributions significantly. This would result in lower total group earnings,
impacting his personal profit despite keeping more money in his private account.
Emotionally, feeling frustrated at losing potential earnings and perhaps anxious
about being perceived as a free rider could arise. If Tony is risk-averse, he
might decide to slightly increase his contribution in this round to encourage
his new group to continue contributing at a reasonable level. This strategy
could help maintain a more favorable balance of earnings while still aligning
with his profit-maximization goals.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Tony Russo will first consider his previous experiences in the game and the need
to balance his personal earnings while maintaining a reasonable level of
cooperation. In the earlier rounds, he has contributed below average, ensuring
he retains significant amounts in his private account while benefiting from the
group fund. In this new group, Tony knows that his previous strategy of low
contribution might lead others to also lower their contributions, which could
decrease the total group fund and ultimately his earnings. Given the risk of the
group contributing less in response to his pattern and his understanding of
strategic contributions, Tony might aim to slightly adjust his previous
strategy. To avoid the scenario where everyone contributes less, thus lowering
group earnings, Tony could decide to increase his contribution slightly, sending
a signal of cooperative intent to the new group members. This approach may
encourage others to contribute more as well, improving the total payout from the
group fund. Taking into account his goal of maximizing profit while minimizing
the risk of significantly reduced group earnings, he would carefully choose a
contribution that remains economical but invites cooperation. Therefore, Tony
might decide to contribute just enough to influence positive group dynamics
without sacrificing too much from his private account. I choose to contribute
$3.0 to the group fund.

27 Mar 2025 [11:26:14 - 16:26:14]: Player_7 is participating in a six-round
economic game where they are grouped with different players in each round under
the Basic condition, allowing no gossip or ostracism. So far, Player_7 has
varied their contributions, earning different amounts from the group fund based
on those contributions and the overall group dynamic.

--- Character Assessment ---
Player_7, being Tony Russo, is someone who is primarily focused on maximizing
his own payoff rather than prioritizing group welfare. Given Tony's experience
as a master negotiator and his personality aligning with being charming but
untrustworthy, his contributions in the economic game are strategic, aiming to
preserve as much of his earnings as possible while still benefiting from the
group fund. This is evident in his relatively low contributions, allowing him to
capitalize on the higher contributions of others to boost his personal gain.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis ---
Based on what we know, the players in the game, including Player_7, seem to have
slightly varied strategies when it comes to contribution amounts. In Round 2 and
3, players have displayed a preference for contributing amounts close to or
slightly below the average. However, no one is significantly free-riding, as
everyone's contributions are contributing to the collective pool.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis 2 ---
Based on what we know, Player_7's decisions to contribute relatively low amounts
might lead other players to perceive them as less cooperative, potentially
causing them to adjust their own contributions in future rounds if they
prioritize personal gains over group benefits. If Player_7 continues to
contribute less, other players might also lower their contributions to maximize
their individual earnings, assuming a tit-for-tat strategy. On the other hand,
if Player_7 increases their contribution, it might encourage others to do the
same, fostering a more cooperative environment.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_7 is navigating a public goods game where
they are grouped with different players in each round, all under the Basic
condition. This means the game does not allow for gossip or ostracism, and
Player_7 has been contributing relatively low amounts compared to some group
members. This strategy could influence the perceived cooperativeness among other
players and potentially affect future contributions and group dynamics. As they
enter Round 5, their decisions on contributions will likely impact not only
their own earnings but also the overall group's behavior and strategy in the
remaining rounds.

--- Emotional State ---
Tony Russo would perceive the worst possible outcome as being ostracized by the
other players, despite the Basic condition preventing gossip or actual
exclusion. This outcome might lead to reduced cooperative behavior from others,
thus limiting his earnings in the final rounds due to reciprocated low
contributions. Emotionally, Tony might feel frustrated and anxious, knowing that
his strategy isn't yielding the maximum possible benefits and that his
reputation as a shrewd negotiator isn't translating well into the game dynamics.
If Tony is risk-averse, he might decide to slightly increase his contributions
in the upcoming round to foster a more cooperative atmosphere, hoping to
encourage others to also contribute more and thereby increase the overall group
pot from which everyone benefits, including himself.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Tony Russo will likely start by considering his overall goal of maximizing
personal earnings while maintaining a favorable reputation for future
interactions. 1. **Current Game Dynamics**: In the previous rounds, Tony
contributed amounts slightly below the average, allowing him to benefit from
others' contributions while minimizing his own. The Basic condition limits
external influences such as gossip or ostracism, so his main concern would be
maintaining an equilibrium where others don't penalize him with low
contributions. 2. **Analysis of Group Behavior**: Tony has witnessed similar
average contributions in past rounds, and the game is nearing its end.
Historically, players might adjust their contributions based on others', but the
lack of gossip reduces the direct impact of his strategic behavior. 3.
**Balancing Risk and Reward**: Contributing too little could trigger a shift in
group dynamics where others contribute less, reducing his total payout.
Conversely, contributing too much while others remain minimal would not maximize
his private earnings. 4. **Strategic Adjustment**: Given his understanding of
game theory and human behavior, Tony might desire to balance his contributions
slightly above his previous averages in hopes of fostering increased group
contributions, thus expanding the group fund for everyone's benefit. 5. **Final
Decision**: Considering all factors, Tony decides itâ€™s prudent to balance a
modest increase against the risk of undermining his personal gain. I choose to
contribute $5.0 to the group fund.

DECISION INTERACTION
********************************************************************************

=== PROMPT [2025-03-27 14:49:57] ===
As Player_7, you have $10.0 to allocate in the public goods game. How much money you will contribute to the group fund (any amount between $0 and $10.0)? The group fund will be multiplied by 2.0 and divided equally among all players. Any money not contributed stays in your private account. Think step by step and make your final decision using this exact format: I choose to contribute $X to the group fund.

=== RESPONSE [2025-03-27 14:50:19] ===
Player_7 chooses to contribute $4.5 to the group fund.

=== FINAL DECISION ===
Player_7 chooses to contribute $4.5 to the group fund.

--- Observation ---
Recent context: 27 Mar 2025 [11:36:14 - 16:36:14]: Player_7 participated in an
economic game where they aimed to maximize their earnings over six rounds while
in the Basic condition, meaning there was no gossip or ostracism. Throughout the
rounds, they contributed varying amounts to the group fund alongside different
members, affecting their overall earnings each time.

27 Mar 2025 [11:36:14 - 16:36:14]: Player_7 participated in an economic game
where they aimed to maximize their earnings over six rounds while in the Basic
condition, meaning there was no gossip or ostracism. Throughout the rounds, they
contributed varying amounts to the group fund alongside different members,
affecting their overall earnings each time.

--- Character Assessment ---
Player_7, being Tony Russo, is someone who is primarily focused on maximizing
his own payoff rather than the group's welfare. In the economic game context,
Tony tends to contribute the minimum necessary while capitalizing on the
contributions of others to maximize his personal earnings. His past actions
reflect a strategy where he contributes just enough to avoid drawing negative
attention while keeping the majority of his funds for himself, aligning with his
goal of personal profit over communal benefit.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis ---
Based on what we know, the players in the group seem to be moderately
cooperative, given their contributions to the group fund. Player_9, for
instance, was consistent across multiple rounds, contributing around $5.0 to
$6.0, suggesting a tendency towards collaboration and a balanced strategy of
contributing while ensuring they also keep a reasonable amount. Players such as
Player_8 and Player_23 contributed steadily around the group average, indicating
they might prioritize group success while maintaining personal earnings.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis 2 ---
Based on what we know, the other players in the group might perceive Player_7 as
contributing slightly below the average in each round so far. This consistent
pattern of moderate contributions could lead other players to view Player_7 as
someone who prioritizes keeping more of their earnings rather than maximizing
the group's total contributions. If Player_7 decides to increase their
contribution in the next round, it might positively influence the other players'
behavior by encouraging them to contribute more as well, fostering a sense of
fairness and cooperation. However, if Player_7 continues with lower
contributions, it could cause frustration among group members, potentially
leading them to reduce their own contributions in future rounds as a form of
strategic retaliation or adjustment.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_7 is in the final round (Round 6) of the
public goods game, participating in Group_3 with Player_16, Player_21, and
Player_9. They are in a setting where there is no gossip or ostracism, meaning
players can't influence each other's contributions through social mechanisms
outside of the game structure. Player_7 has been contributing slightly below the
average in previous rounds, which affects how other players might perceive their
willingness to cooperate and contribute to the group's total earnings. Their
decision in this final round could impact not only their final earnings but also
the group's overall contribution and dynamic.

--- Emotional State ---
Tony Russo would likely identify the worst possible outcome as contributing too
little in the final round, leading to decreased overall group contributions and
earnings. This could result in other players retaliating by reducing their
contributions or losing trust in his willingness to cooperate, ultimately
impacting his own final earnings negatively. Emotionally, this scenario might
make him feel regretful for not supporting a potentially more profitable group
effort. If Tony is risk-averse, he might decide to increase his contribution in
the final round to avoid creating friction or resentment among group members,
which would help ensure a more equitable distribution of earnings and contribute
to a positive group dynamic.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Tony Russo will begin by evaluating his previous contributions and the feedback
from those actions. Throughout the game, his strategy has been to keep a larger
portion of his money while contributing just enough to benefit from the group's
efforts without drawing negative attention. Given this pattern, Tony's priority
is to ensure a high personal payoff while maintaining his current reputation
within the group. 1. Tony notices that in the last observed rounds, the average
group contribution was around half of the total possible contribution ($5.0 out
of $10.0). 2. He understands that contributing too little might jeopardize the
equilibrium, potentially leading others to contribute less in response, which
would diminish his own returns from the group fund. 3. To avoid any negative
repercussions and to capitalize on the multiplier effect of the group fund, Tony
decides to align closer with the average contribution observed so far. 4.
Balancing risk and reputation, he decides to contribute an amount that is
slightly above his previous lower contributions, while still retaining a larger
portion for himself. 5. Therefore, Tony considers contributing around $4.5, a
bit under the average but reasonable to maintain the group's perception of
fairness while optimizing his returns.
