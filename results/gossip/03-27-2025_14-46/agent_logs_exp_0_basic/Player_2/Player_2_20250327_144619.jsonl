Given his cynical worldview and suspicion that most people are inherently selfish, Derek likely approaches the economic game with caution and skepticism about others' intentions. This mindset might lead him to contribute just enough to benefit from the group fund without overcommitting his resources, which aligns with his history of varied contributions across rounds. His strategy appears to be focused more on preserving individual gains rather than maximizing the collective earnings of the group.", "", "Theory of Mind Analysis: Based on what we know, the participants in the public goods game exhibit varying levels of contribution, indicating different strategies and possibly differing levels of cooperation. In earlier rounds, contributions range widely among players, suggesting some are more cooperative (contributing higher amounts), while others lean towards self-interest (contributing lower amounts). For instance, players like Player_9 and Player_24 have varying contribution levels, which may reflect a strategy to balance earning from both personal retention and group fund payouts.", "", "Theory of Mind Analysis 2: Based on what we know, other players might evaluate my contributions compared to theirs and the average. If I consistently contribute less than others, they might perceive me as not fully cooperating or as trying to benefit more from their contributions. However, if I contribute close to or above the average, they might see me as a cooperative and fair player. My next decision to either increase or decrease my contribution could influence their perception of me and potentially affect the group's overall cooperation.

In previous rounds, Player_2 has contributed amounts close to or above the average group contribution, which has influenced their earnings positively. They are in the Basic condition, so they do not have to worry about gossip or being ostracized, but their contribution choices still impact how others may perceive their cooperation level. Balancing their contributions relative to others while maximizing personal earnings is crucial to maintain a positive perception and encourage group cooperation in future rounds.", "", "Emotional State: Derek Foster would likely view the worst possible outcome as a situation where his contribution to the group fund ends up being significantly higher than others, resulting in his personal earnings being lower than anticipated. This could happen if the other players contribute very little or even nothing, thereby benefiting more from his generosity while he gains less from the group fund. Emotionally, this scenario would likely make Derek feel frustrated and validated in his skepticism about others' selfish intentions. To avoid this outcome, especially if he is risk-averse, Derek would likely choose to contribute an amount close to the average from previous rounds or slightly lower to ensure he's not overly committed and can still benefit if others decide to free ride.

Derek recognizes that contributing more can lead to higher group earnings but may also discourage high free-riding behavior if others contribute less.", "", "2. **Personal Strategy and Risk Aversion**: Derek aims to maintain a balance between maximizing personal earnings and contributing sufficiently to avoid negative perception. Given his cautious nature and strategy to minimize personal losses while still benefiting from collective gains, contributing slightly above or near the average from past rounds ensures he does not fall behind in earnings if others contribute as expected.", "", "3. **Calculations and Contributions Across Rounds**: In past rounds, contributions have typically been around half of his available amount, ending in balanced personal retention and group benefits. This provides an outline for his current decision to maintain coherence with previous strategy.", "", "4. **Emotional Considerations and Group Dynamics**: Derek knows that a small increase over the minimum could foster some goodwill and potentially lead to greater group contributions in the future rounds. His experiences tell him being too generous might lead to others exploiting that generosity, causing financial discomfort.", "", "5. **Final Decision**: Weighing the average contributions and his anticipated emotional reactions to different scenarios, Derek positions himself to safeguard against extreme outcomes.", "", "Considering all of this, Derek Foster would likely decide on contributing a strategic amount that aligns with past behaviors and continues to maximize his benefits subtly.", "", "I choose to contribute $5.0 to the group fund.", "", "Exercise: As Player_2, you have $10.0 to allocate in the public goods game.
