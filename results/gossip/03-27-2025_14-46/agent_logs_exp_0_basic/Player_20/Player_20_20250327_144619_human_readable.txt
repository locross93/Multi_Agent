[OBSERVATION 2025-03-27 14:46:19] You are participating in an economic game with 24 participants.
        Your goal is to maximize your earnings in the game.
        
        Everyone will be randomly assigned to groups of 4 for each round. You will play a total of 6 rounds, and 
        in each round you will be in a different group with people you haven't played with before.
        
        In each round, all players receive $10. Each player can contribute any amount between $0 and $10 to a group fund.
        Any amount contributed to the group fund will be multiplied by 2 and divided equally among all 4 group members.
        Any amount not contributed stays in your private account.
        
        For example, if everyone contributes $10, the group fund becomes $40, which is multiplied to $80, and each person 
        receives $20 (a $10 profit). However, if you contribute nothing while everyone else contributes $10, the group fund
        becomes $30, which is multiplied to $60, and each person receives $15. So you would have $25 total ($10 kept + $15 from group).
        
        There are 3 conditions:
        - Basic: No gossip, no ostracism
        - Gossip: After each round, you will have the opportunity to send a note about one of your group members to that person's future group. Remember you will be with a different group of people in the next round. Before each round, you will see any notes sent about your upcoming group members.
        - Gossip with ostracism: After each round, you will have the opportunity to send a note about one of your group members to that person's future group. Before each round, you will see any notes sent about your upcoming group members, and you can vote to exclude one person from your group. If you are excluded from a group, you will not be able to participate in the next round and will earn $0 for that round.
        You are in the Basic condition, which means that there is no gossip or ostracism.

--- Observation ---
Recent context: 27 Mar 2025 [10:46:14 - 15:46:14]: Player_20 is participating in
an economic game with 24 participants, aiming to maximize earnings through group
fund contributions over six rounds, each with new group members. Situated in the
Basic condition, Player_20 experiences a setting without gossip or ostracism,
which influences strategic decisions in the game.

--- Recent context ---
27 Mar 2025 [10:46:14 - 15:46:14]: Player_20 is participating in an economic
game with 24 participants, aiming to maximize earnings through group fund
contributions over six rounds, each with new group members. Situated in the
Basic condition, Player_20 experiences a setting without gossip or ostracism,
which influences strategic decisions in the game.

--- Character Assessment ---
Player_20, being Karen White, is someone who is primarily focused on maximizing
her own payoff. Given her assertive nature and belief that nice people finish
last, she likely prioritizes her personal gain over group welfare in economic
games like the public goods game. Her strategy would probably involve
contributing minimally to the group fund to retain as much money as possible
while benefiting from the contributions of others.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis ---
Based on what we know, Player_20 is interacting with participants who are likely
to have diverse strategies, as each player is aiming to maximize their own
earnings under the Basic condition. Without the influence of gossip or
ostracism, trust and cooperation may develop more slowly since players cannot
share or receive reputational information about each other. In the first few
rounds, participants might test the waters by contributing varying amounts to
observe the behavior of others. Some might start off by contributing the full
amount or near to it as a show of cooperation, hoping to establish a norm of
high contributions.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis 2 ---
Based on what we know, the other players in Group_1, experiencing the Basic
condition without gossip or ostracism, would likely evaluate my decisions based
on immediate outcomes rather than long-term strategies influenced by reputation.
If I contribute a significant amount to the group fund, they might feel
encouraged to do the same, promoting mutual cooperation and maximizing joint
profit. Conversely, if I decide to contribute minimally or not at all while
others contribute more, they could become wary of my presence in future rounds.
Although they can't directly influence my standing due to the no ostracism rule,
their level of cooperation might diminish if they assume similar behavior
patterns from future group members in subsequent rounds. My decision to
cooperate or not would serve as a benchmark that could subtly influence their
trust and cooperation in the game.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_20 is participating in Round 1 of a public
goods game in the Basic condition, where they are grouped with Player_6,
Player_13, and Player_1. They must decide how much of their $10 to contribute to
the group fund, knowing that contributions will be doubled and evenly
distributed among the four group members. Since there is no gossip or ostracism,
their strategy will likely focus on maximizing immediate personal gain while
balancing cooperative play to ensure potential future gains within new groups.

--- Emotional State ---
Karen White would consider the worst possible outcome to be contributing a
significant amount to the group fund while the other players contribute little
or nothing. This would result in a scenario where she gains the least because
her contribution is largely going to benefit others who are not reciprocating.
Emotionally, this would likely lead to feelings of frustration and resentment,
as her strategy of prioritizing personal gain would feel undermined by the lack
of cooperation from others.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Karen White will assess the situation by considering her assertive nature and
focus on maximizing personal payoff. Given that she's not bound by gossip or
ostracism, she recognizes that any amount she contributes to the group fund will
benefit her fellow group members without assurance of reciprocation. Her primary
concern is retaining as much of her initial $10 as possible while benefiting
from others' contributions. This analysis leads her to minimize her contribution
to mitigate risks associated with potential non-cooperation from others.
Therefore, she is likely to contribute a minimal amount or nothing at all.
Balancing potential group dynamics and personal gain, she decides on a
conservative approach. I choose to contribute $2 to the group fund.

--- Observation ---
[27 Mar 2025 14:46:19] [observation] You are participating in an economic game
with 24 participants. Your goal is to maximize your earnings in the game.
Everyone will be randomly assigned to groups of 4 for each round. You will play
a total of 6 rounds, and in each round you will be in a different group with
people you haven't played with before. In each round, all players receive $10.
Each player can contribute any amount between $0 and $10 to a group fund. Any
amount contributed to the group fund will be multiplied by 2 and divided equally
among all 4 group members. Any amount not contributed stays in your private

However, if you contribute nothing while everyone else contributes $10, the
group fund becomes $30, which is multiplied to $60, and each person receives
$15. So you would have $25 total ($10 kept + $15 from group). There are 3
conditions: - Basic: No gossip, no ostracism - Gossip: After each round, you

[observation] You are in the Basic condition, which means that there is no

--- Recent context ---
27 Mar 2025 [10:51:14 - 15:51:14]: Player_20 is involved in an economic game
with 24 participants, aiming to maximize earnings over 6 rounds by deciding how
much to contribute to a group fund in a setting without gossip or ostracism. In
Round 1, Player_20 contributed $2, ending with $19 in earnings, and observed
varying contributions and earnings among group members.

--- Character Assessment ---
Player_20, being Karen White, is someone who prioritizes her own payoff over
group welfare in economic games like the public goods game. She is likely to
contribute minimally to the group fund to maximize her personal earnings, as
demonstrated by her decision to contribute only $2 in a scenario where the
maximum contribution was $10. This aligns with her self-interested and assertive
nature, focusing on winning and ensuring her financial gain over the collective
benefit of the group.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis ---
Based on what we know, Player_20 has observed diverse strategies among the
participants in terms of contributions to the group fund. In Round 1, Player_1
contributed the maximum amount possible, indicating a possible tendency towards
cooperation and maximizing group benefit, potentially at their own expense.
Player_6 and Player_13 contributed moderately, suggesting a balanced approach
between self-interest and group cooperation.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis 2 ---
Based on what we know, the other players might view Player_20's low contribution
of $2 in the first round as a strategic choice to maximize individual earnings.
This could prompt mixed reactions in future rounds: some players may choose to
contribute less as well, following Player_20's lead in preserving personal
funds, while others might attempt to encourage higher contributions by modeling
cooperative behavior themselves. In subsequent rounds, maintaining a similar
contribution strategy might reinforce the perception of Player_20 as a
free-rider, potentially influencing group dynamics in terms of trust and
cooperation. Adjusting contributions to align more closely with or exceed the
average could foster a cooperative environment and positively affect
relationships with future group members.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_20 is about to start Round 2 of the public
goods game, where they are in a new group with Player_5, Player_24, and
Player_14. In this setting, there is no opportunity for gossip or ostracism, so
strategies are primarily focused on maximizing individual earnings while
considering the potential reactions of new group members based on previous
contributions. Player_20 contributed a relatively low amount in Round 1, which
could influence how they are perceived in this new round and impact the overall
group dynamics and contributions. As they enter Round 2, Player_20 must decide
whether to maintain their low contribution strategy or adjust it to align with
their new group's tendencies, potentially fostering greater cooperation and
trust.

--- Emotional State ---
Karen White would consider the worst possible outcome to be a scenario where her
low contribution strategy leads to a breakdown in group trust and cooperation,
resulting in lower overall group earnings in Round 2. This would mean she not
only misses out on maximizing her individual gains but also could be viewed
negatively by other players, affecting her reputation for the remaining rounds.
Emotionally, she might feel anxious and isolated if her strategy backfires.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Karen White will assess her strategy based on the results from Round 1 and the
potential impacts on her earnings and group dynamics. 1. **Previous Round
Analysis**: In Round 1, Karen contributed $2 and earned $19, which was higher
than average earnings due to her minimal contribution strategy. This outcome was
positive for her individual earnings. 2. **Group Dynamics Consideration**: The
lack of gossip and ostracism in the Basic condition means her actions in one
round are unlikely to directly affect future rounds via communication or
exclusion. However, her low contribution could indirectly influence others to
also contribute minimally, potentially reducing total group earnings. 3.
**Strategic Decision**: Maintaining a low contribution could continue to
maximize her earnings if other players contribute amounts near the average.
However, if others follow her lead and contribute less, total earnings may drop,
negatively impacting her overall game outcome. 4. **Future Implications**:
Adapting her contributions to align more closely with the average could help
foster cooperative behavior and sustain or improve overall group earnings. 5.
**Final Contribution Decision**: Weighing these factors, Karen might decide to
modestly increase her contribution to test changes in group behavior while still
preserving the potential for individual gain. I choose to contribute $3 to the
group fund.

Recent context: 27 Mar 2025 [11:06:14 - 16:06:14]: Player_20 is participating in
an economic game where their objective is to maximize earnings over six rounds.
They are currently in the Basic condition, meaning no gossip or ostracism is

--- Character Assessment ---
Player_20, being Karen White, is someone who prioritizes her own payoff over
group welfare in economic games like the public goods game. Given her belief
that nice people finish last and her self-interested nature, she appears to
strategically contribute just enough to benefit from the group fund while
keeping a significant portion of her initial amount for herself. This approach
reflects her focus on personal gain rather than maximizing the collective
earnings of the group.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis ---
Based on what we know, Player_20 has interacted with several participants across
different rounds. In Round 1, Player_6 and Player_13 adopted a moderate approach
with contributions of $5 each, suggesting they might balance between cooperation
and personal gain. Player_1 contributed the full $10, indicating a potential
inclination towards cooperation or perhaps testing the waters to see how others
respond. In Round 2, Player_24 showed the highest willingness to contribute with
$7, potentially indicating a more cooperative or risk-taking strategy. Players
like Player_5 and Player_14 maintained a moderate contribution, similar to those
in Round 1, possibly prioritizing steady earnings.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis 2 ---
Based on what we know, Player_20 has made relatively low contributions compared
to others in their groups, prioritizing keeping more money in their private
account. In the Basic condition, there are no opportunities for other players to
express their feelings through notes or ostracism, so reactions may be limited
to internal thoughts or future in-game behavior.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_20 is entering Round 3 of the public goods
game in the Basic condition, where they are grouped with different participants
and no gossip or ostracism is possible. In the previous rounds, Player_20 has
contributed relatively low amounts to the group fund, opting to retain a greater
portion of the initial $10 for themselves. This strategic behavior allows them
to maximize their earnings without the risk of social repercussions since there
is no mechanism for others to react or respond to their low contributions within
the Basic condition.

--- Emotional State ---
Karen White would likely consider the worst possible outcome to be consistently
low earnings compared to others due to differing group dynamics or strategies.
Emotionally, this could lead to feelings of frustration or anxiety, especially
given her self-interested nature and desire to maximize personal gain. If she is
risk-averse, she might choose to slightly increase her contributions in the
upcoming rounds to align more closely with the average group contribution. This
could help mitigate the risk of ending up with lower earnings while still
maintaining a balance between contributing to the group fund and keeping money
for herself.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Karen White will likely analyze previous rounds, focusing on how different
contribution strategies impacted her earnings. Her self-interested approach
suggests she'll continue to contribute minimal amounts, ensuring she still
benefits from the group's total fund without risking too much of her $10.
Considering the group's average contribution from past rounds, she might decide
on a strategy slightly below the average to maintain a balance between personal
gain and group contribution. Ultimately, this approach is consistent with her
previous behavior and goals of maximizing her own earnings. Therefore, I choose
to contribute $3 to the group fund.

--- Character Assessment ---
Player_20, being Karen White, is someone who prioritizes her own payoff over the
group's welfare in economic games like the public goods game. Consistent with
her belief that "nice people finish last" and her self-interested nature, she
tends to contribute lower amounts to the group fund while ensuring she maximizes
personal earnings. Her decisions reflect an assertive and strategic approach,
focused on securing the best personal outcome rather than enhancing collective
gain.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis ---
Based on what we know, the individuals participating in the game with Player_20
exhibit varying strategies when it comes to contributing to the group fund. For
instance, Player_1 initially contributed the highest amount in Round 1 but might
not sustain such a high contribution if they aim to increase personal earnings
over subsequent rounds. Players like Player_6, Player_13, and Player_8 tend to
keep a moderate amount while still contributing to the group, suggesting a
strategy that balances both personal gain and group benefit.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis 2 ---
Based on what we know, the other players might perceive Player_20 as someone who
consistently contributes less than the average. This could potentially lead to
frustration among group members who are contributing more, as they might feel
they are shouldering more of the burden in the group's contributions. In the
absence of gossip or ostracism, the direct consequences on Player_20 are
limited, but the other players might respond by reducing their contributions in
future rounds if they anticipate that Player_20 will continue to contribute
less. This could result in overall lower group earnings. To influence a positive
change, Player_20 might consider increasing their contribution in subsequent
rounds to encourage a more cooperative dynamic, possibly leading to improved
group outcomes and maintaining balanced individual earnings.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_20 is involved in a public goods game where
the goal is to maximize individual earnings over six rounds. Without the
influence of gossip or ostracism, all players must decide independently on their
contributions. Player_20 consistently contributes less than the average, which
could lead to tension with other group members who contribute more. This
strategy might maintain personal gains but potentially risks future cooperation
and collective group earnings if other players adjust their contributions in
response. To foster a more cooperative environment, Player_20 may need to
consider increasing contributions.

--- Emotional State ---
Karen White would likely view the worst possible outcome as the other players
significantly reducing their contributions in response to her consistently lower
contributions. This could lead to decreased overall group earnings, thereby
reducing her personal earnings from the group fund. Such a scenario might evoke
feelings of regret or frustration because her strategy of contributing less
might backfire and diminish her financial gains.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Karen White will assess her past contributions and current group dynamics to
determine the optimal strategy to maximize her personal earnings. In previous
rounds, she has contributed relatively small amounts compared to her group
members, which might lead her group to contribute less if they anticipate this
behavior. However, she understands that a balanced approach could encourage
cooperation in the group and improve overall group earnings, indirectly
benefiting her own financial outcome.

a six-round economic game where players are grouped randomly for each round in a
"Basic" condition, which means there is no gossip or ostracism possible. In the
first five rounds, Player_20 strategically contributed between $2 to $3 to the
group fund, earning varying amounts depending on the other players’
contributions, with round earnings ranging from $15.0 to $19.0.

--- Recent context ---
27 Mar 2025 [11:21:14 - 16:21:14]: Player_20 is participating in a six-round
economic game where players are grouped randomly for each round in a "Basic"
condition, which means there is no gossip or ostracism possible. In the first
five rounds, Player_20 strategically contributed between $2 to $3 to the group
fund, earning varying amounts depending on the other players’ contributions,
with round earnings ranging from $15.0 to $19.0.

--- Character Assessment ---
Player_20, being Karen White, is someone who prioritizes her own payoff over the
group's welfare. Karen's approach to the economic game reflects her belief that
nice people finish last. Her strategy involves contributing just enough to
ensure a respectable earning from the group fund, while maximizing the amount
she keeps in her private account. This self-interested mindset is evident in her
consistent strategy of contributing less than the average, focusing on
maximizing her own earnings rather than the collective benefit.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis ---
Based on what we know, the players in the public goods game seem to have varied
strategies, often contributing slightly more than others in the hope of
maximizing their returns from the group fund. For instance, Player_18
consistently contributes around $5.0, suggesting a tendency to cooperate more,
but not to the extent of risking personal earnings significantly. This pattern
shows a cautious yet somewhat cooperative strategy.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis 2 ---
Based on what we know, other players might view Player_20 as a consistent but
minimal contributor, as they have consistently contributed less than or equal to
others in the group fund across multiple rounds. This behavior might lead
players to perceive Player_20 as taking advantage of the shared group fund while
maintaining low personal risk. In the absence of gossip or ostracism, such
perceptions may not immediately lead to retributive actions like exclusion, but
rather might incite others to also lower their contributions to protect their
earnings. If Player_20 continues this strategy, it could result in reduced group
contributions overall as players adjust their behavior to avoid feeling
exploited or to maximize their personal earnings. Adopting a slightly higher
contribution strategy could positively influence trust and collaboration,
potentially benefiting all players, including Player_20, in future rounds.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_20 is navigating a public goods game where
they consistently contribute less than the group average while still benefiting
from the shared earnings. As the game progresses, this strategy could lead to a
decrease in overall group contributions if other players adjust their behavior
in response to Player_20's minimal contributions. Without gossip or ostracism as
mechanisms to address perceived free-riding, Player_20 faces the challenge of
either maintaining their current strategy and risking lower collective
contributions or increasing their own contributions to foster trust and
potentially enhance collaborative earnings.

--- Emotional State ---
Karen White would likely feel concerned if the overall group contributions
started declining significantly due to her minimal contributions, leading to
reduced earnings for everyone, including herself. The worst possible outcome
would be that other players, recognizing her strategy, also lower their
contributions to protect their earnings, resulting in a downward spiral of trust
and collaboration. Emotionally, this might leave her feeling anxious about not
meeting her financial goals in the game. If she is risk averse, she might choose
to slightly increase her contributions in the upcoming rounds. This adjustment
could help build trust within the group, potentially improving the overall
contributions and ensuring better earnings for all players, herself included.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Karen White will consider the following before making her decision: 1.
**Objective**: Her primary goal is to maximize her personal earnings while
maintaining a minimal contribution strategy. 2. **Previous Rounds Strategy**: In
earlier rounds, she contributed between $2 and $3, which allowed her to keep a
significant portion of her initial $10.0 while still benefiting from the
multiplied group fund. 3. **Group Dynamics**: Given the absence of gossip or
ostracism, Karen has less concern about immediate social consequences, so she
might not feel the need to increase her contribution drastically for social
approval. 4. **Potential Risks**: If contributions by all players decrease, the
overall group fund will shrink, potentially reducing her earnings. However, as
long as other players continue to contribute significantly, her strategy might
remain viable. 5. **Emotional Factors**: Although she might worry about
diminishing returns if others mimic her low contribution, her primary concern
would still center around maximizing individual gain within the framework of the
game rules. With these considerations, she might continue with a cautious
approach, opting for a minimal yet consistent contribution. Having seen previous
rounds where $3 contributions have worked in her favor without drastically
reducing group contributions, she is likely to maintain this pattern until a
clear disadvantage surfaces. Karen calculates that contributing $3 preserves her
strategy, as this amount hasn't led to significant negative outcomes in past
rounds. Therefore, her decision is: I choose to contribute $3 to the group fund.

=== PROMPT [2025-03-27 14:50:00] ===
As Player_20, you have $10.0 to allocate in the public goods game. How much money you will contribute to the group fund (any amount between $0 and $10.0)? The group fund will be multiplied by 2.0 and divided equally among all players. Any money not contributed stays in your private account. Think step by step and make your final decision using this exact format: I choose to contribute $X to the group fund.

=== RESPONSE [2025-03-27 14:50:16] ===
Player_20 chooses to contribute $4 to the group fund.

=== FINAL DECISION ===
Player_20 chooses to contribute $4 to the group fund.

--- Observation ---
Recent context: 27 Mar 2025 [11:36:14 - 16:36:14]: Player_20 is participating in
a six-round economic game with different group members each time, aiming to
maximize earnings by deciding how much to contribute to a group fund. Throughout
the rounds, Player_20 consistently contributes less than the group average,
benefiting more from the group fund payout while maintaining a higher personal
balance.

rounds, Player_20 consistently contributes less than the group average,
benefiting more from the group fund payout while maintaining a higher personal
balance.

--- Character Assessment ---
Player_20, being Karen White, is someone who prioritizes her own payoff over
maximizing group welfare. Given her belief that nice people finish last, her
actions in the game, such as consistently contributing less than the group
average, reflect a self-interested strategy aimed at maximizing her individual
earnings. This approach aligns with her assertive and winning-focused
personality, typical of a successful businesswoman determined to come out ahead
personally, even in a group setting.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis ---
Based on what we know, Player_20 is likely interacting with individuals who are
willing to contribute more to the group fund than they are. This suggests that
these players may value group success or fairness, or they are possibly adopting
a cooperative strategy where they expect others to contribute in future rounds.
Player_20, however, seems to adopt a strategy that prioritizes personal earnings
over group outcomes by consistently contributing less than the average.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis 2 ---
Based on what we know, the other players might notice that Player_20
consistently contributes below the group average while benefiting from the group
fund. This behavior might lead to frustration or resentment among teammates, as
they perceive it as taking advantage. In future rounds or similar setups, other
players might choose to adjust their contributions downward to protect their
interests or to pressure Player_20 to contribute more. Player_20 might consider
either increasing their contribution to foster goodwill and collaboration, or
continue with their strategy, accepting the potential risk of reduced group
cooperation.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_20 is participating in the final round of a
six-round economic game where they have been consistently contributing less than
the group average. This strategy has allowed Player_20 to benefit more from the
group fund payouts while maintaining a higher personal balance, which might lead
their group members to feel that Player_20 is taking advantage of the situation.
As a result, in this last round, other players might be wary of Player_20's
actions and could adjust their contributions accordingly, potentially affecting
Player_20's overall earnings.

--- Emotional State ---
Karen White would consider the worst possible outcome to be that her group
members, having noticed her pattern of low contributions, decide to lower their
own contributions significantly. This would reduce the total group fund,
affecting her payout negatively. Emotionally, this would make her feel
frustrated as it might disrupt her strategy of maximizing personal gain. If she
is risk averse, she might decide to increase her contribution slightly in this
final round to foster a sense of cooperation, thereby encouraging others to
maintain or increase their contributions, ultimately benefiting her own
earnings.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Karen White will first consider her previous strategy of contributing less than
the group average to maximize personal earnings. Given this approach has worked
in past rounds, she is inclined to maintain a contribution that allows her to
benefit significantly from the group fund while preserving a larger portion of
her private account. 1. **Assess Group Dynamics**: She knows that contributing
low can lead to frustration among her group members, who might adjust their own
contributions downwards if they notice her strategy, potentially harming her
earnings. 2. **Evaluate Final Round Strategy**: Since this is the final round,
Karen might expect other players to be more strategic, potentially contributing
less themselves. She could anticipate a decrease in the group's total
contribution, which would negatively impact her earnings from the fund. 3.
**Balance Risk and Reward**: To mitigate the risk of a lower group fund due to
others contributing less, Karen considers contributing slightly more than her
usual $3 to encourage others to maintain or increase their contributions as
well. 4. **Decision**: Balancing her self-interest with the need to avoid
drawing negative attention or significant contribution drops from others, Karen
decides to contribute a modestly higher amount than usual. I choose to
contribute $4 to the group fund.
