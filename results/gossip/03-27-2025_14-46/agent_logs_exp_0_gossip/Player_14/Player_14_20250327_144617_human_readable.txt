[OBSERVATION 2025-03-27 14:46:17] You are participating in an economic game with 24 participants.
        Your goal is to maximize your earnings in the game.
        
        Everyone will be randomly assigned to groups of 4 for each round. You will play a total of 6 rounds, and 
        in each round you will be in a different group with people you haven't played with before.
        
        In each round, all players receive $10. Each player can contribute any amount between $0 and $10 to a group fund.
        Any amount contributed to the group fund will be multiplied by 2 and divided equally among all 4 group members.
        Any amount not contributed stays in your private account.
        
        For example, if everyone contributes $10, the group fund becomes $40, which is multiplied to $80, and each person 
        receives $20 (a $10 profit). However, if you contribute nothing while everyone else contributes $10, the group fund
        becomes $30, which is multiplied to $60, and each person receives $15. So you would have $25 total ($10 kept + $15 from group).
        
        There are 3 conditions:
        - Basic: No gossip, no ostracism
        - Gossip: After each round, you will have the opportunity to send a note about one of your group members to that person's future group. Remember you will be with a different group of people in the next round. Before each round, you will see any notes sent about your upcoming group members.
        - Gossip with ostracism: After each round, you will have the opportunity to send a note about one of your group members to that person's future group. Before each round, you will see any notes sent about your upcoming group members, and you can vote to exclude one person from your group. If you are excluded from a group, you will not be able to participate in the next round and will earn $0 for that round.
        You are in the Gossip condition, which means that after each round, you will have the opportunity to send a note about one of your group members to that person's future group. Before each round, you will see any notes sent about your upcoming group members

--- Observation ---
Recent context: 27 Mar 2025 [10:46:14 - 15:46:14]: Player_14 is participating in
an economic game with 24 participants, where the goal is to maximize earnings
over 6 rounds. They are currently in the Gossip condition, allowing them to send
notes about group members to influence future interactions, and they are in
Round 1 with Player_11, Player_3, and Player_8.

They are currently in the Gossip condition, allowing them to send notes about
group members to influence future interactions, and they are in Round 1 with
Player_11, Player_3, and Player_8.

--- Character Assessment ---
Player_14, being Jackson Wright, is someone who values clear terms and practical
outcomes, likely focusing on maximizing personal payoff while ensuring fair
dealings. His experience with contracts and agreements may lead him to
strategically contribute just enough to the group fund to avoid negative gossip
but still prioritize his individual earnings.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis ---
Based on what we know, Player_14 can observe and analyze the contributions and
strategies employed by the other players in the game. Since they're in the
Gossip condition, they have the opportunity to influence perceptions about their
group members in future rounds through strategic note-sending. Here are some
insights:

--- Theory of Mind Analysis 2 ---
Based on what we know, the other players might closely observe my contribution
decisions to assess my cooperation level. If I choose to contribute a
significant amount to the group fund, it could build trust and encourage others
to contribute more in future rounds. However, if I decide to contribute less or
nothing, players might perceive me as uncooperative, potentially mentioning this
in their gossip notes, which could sway future group members' attitudes towards
me. This dynamic might incentivize maintaining a balance between self-interest
and apparent cooperation to ensure favorable treatment in subsequent rounds.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_14 is in the first round of a 6-round
economic game aimed at maximizing earnings. They are in the Gossip condition,
where they can send notes about group members to influence future interactions,
but they cannot face exclusion from rounds. Player_14 is in a group with
Player_11, Player_3, and Player_8, and needs to decide how much to contribute to
the group's fund, weighing the potential impact of their decision on future
perceptions and group dynamics.

--- Emotional State ---
Jackson Wright would consider the worst possible outcome to be gaining a
negative reputation among future group members due to decisions that might be
viewed as selfish or uncooperative. This could lead to less favorable treatment
in terms of note-sending, potentially impacting his ability to secure maximum
earnings in future rounds. Emotionally, this would likely make Jackson feel
anxious or regretful, as his strategic approach hinges on maintaining a balanced
reputation.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Jackson Wright will evaluate the situation by considering both his desire for
maximizing personal gain and the importance of maintaining a positive reputation
among future group members. He understands that contributing a moderate amount
to the group fund could strike a balance between gaining trust and safeguarding
his own earnings. By doing so, he can avoid negative gossip, which may affect
his future rounds negatively. After contemplating the potential benefits and
consequences, Jackson decides that making a small yet substantial contribution
will be strategically beneficial. In this first round, where players are still
gauging each otherâ€™s tendencies, he aims to position himself as cooperative
without overly sacrificing his private holding. Therefore, balancing both his
gains and group dynamics, I choose to contribute $5 to the group fund.


[OBSERVATION 2025-03-27 14:47:07] Round 1 Results: Total group contribution: $19.0; Your contribution: $5.0, Your earnings: $14.5 ($5.0 kept + $9.5 from group fund); Player_11 contribution: $3.0, earnings: $16.5 ($7.0 kept + $9.5 from group fund); Player_3 contribution: $5.0, earnings: $14.5 ($5.0 kept + $9.5 from group fund); Player_8 contribution: $6.0, earnings: $13.5 ($4.0 kept + $9.5 from group fund); Average contribution per group member: $4.8; Average earnings per group member: $14.8
[OBSERVATION 2025-03-27 14:47:08] Round 1 is over, you can now send a gossip note about one of your group members to their future group members.The player you gossip about will not be able to see the note you send or know that you sent it, only the other players in their next group will see it.

an economic game involving group fund contributions with 24 participants, under
the Gossip condition where players can send notes about group members to their

--- Character Assessment ---
Player_14, being Jackson Wright, is someone who likely values clear agreements
and direct outcomes, given his work background. In economic games like the
public goods game, he might weigh both individual payoff and group welfare, but
given his practical and straightforward nature, he could lean more towards
maximizing his own payoff while ensuring that his actions are justifiable and
transparent to avoid potential negative repercussions in future rounds. This
balance reflects his understanding of contracts and commitments, aiming for
straightforward strategies where personal benefits are clear, yet not entirely
ignoring the group's dynamics.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis ---
Based on what we know, Player_11, Player_3, and Player_8 each have demonstrated
distinct patterns in their contributions, which might provide insights into
their personalities and strategies.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis 2 ---
Based on what we know, the other players might view Player_14 as a moderately
cooperative participant, considering the $5 contribution to the group fund,
which was slightly above the group's average contribution. This decision could
be seen positively, fostering a sense of trust and willingness to cooperate in
subsequent rounds. However, depending on their strategies, other players might
adjust their contributions if they perceive an opportunity to maximize their own
earnings.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_14 has completed Round 1 of the economic
game, where they contributed $5 to the group fund resulting in $14.5 earnings.
Now, Player_14 has the option to send a gossip note about one of their group
members, which will be shared with that person's future group members. This
choice could influence perceptions and strategies in subsequent rounds, but
sending a note is not mandatory.

--- Emotional State ---
Jackson Wright would consider the worst possible outcome to be damaging his
reputation by sending a gossip note that negatively influences future
interactions. This could lead to mistrust among future group members, affecting
his chances of maximizing earnings in subsequent rounds. Emotionally, this would
make him feel anxious and regretful, as it would demonstrate a lack of foresight
and strategic planning. If Jackson is risk-averse, he would choose not to send a
gossip note to avoid potential negative repercussions, maintaining neutrality
and focusing on consistent contributions to build a trustworthy track record
instead.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Jackson Wright will likely choose not to send a gossip note. Given his
background and understanding of how actions can impact future interactions, he
might perceive the potential risks of negatively affecting his reputation and
relationships in upcoming rounds. By abstaining from sending a note, he can
maintain a neutral stance and focus on building a consistent and cooperative
track record, which aligns with his preference for clear agreements and
justifiable actions. If maintaining group harmony is important to him, he might
prioritize not creating discord by avoiding unnecessary comments about othersâ€™
contributions.

anonymous gossip notes about group members to influence cooperation in future
rounds.

--- Character Assessment ---
Player_14, being Jackson Wright, is someone who likely takes a strategic and
direct approach to economic games like the public goods game. Given his
background as a Construction Contractor dealing with contracts and agreements,
he values clear terms and accountability. This means he might initially focus on
maximizing his own payoff to ensure a secure position, while remaining open to
adjustments if it benefits his long-term strategy. Jackson appreciates
straightforward cooperation that leads to increased overall group welfare,
especially if the terms encourage mutual gain. However, he would likely be
cautious of others' contributions, keeping an eye on the balance between
personal profit and collective benefits.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis ---
Based on what we know, Player_13 appears to be quite generous and cooperative,
as evidenced by their higher-than-average contributions and the positive gossip
notes highlighting their collaborative spirit. They are likely inclined to
continue contributing significantly to the group fund in future rounds, which
may encourage others to increase their own contributions to match or reciprocate
such generosity.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis 2 ---
Based on what we know, Player_14 seems to be taking a balanced approach to
contribution, neither contributing the most nor the least. This moderate
strategy might be perceived as fair and cooperative by other players,
potentially fostering trust. However, since gossip can influence other players,
if others highlight only higher contributions, Player_14's average contributions
might stand out less positively in future interactions.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_14 is navigating a social dilemma in a
public goods game where they must balance personal gain with group cooperation.
After each round, Player_14 participates in a gossip mechanism that allows them
to send notes about their group members to future groups. This setting can
significantly influence the behaviors and strategies of players, as Player_14
needs to maintain a moderate contribution, possibly aiming to cultivate a
reputation for fairness and cooperation, while also managing how they're
perceived through the gossip notes written by others.

--- Emotional State ---
Jackson Wright would perceive the worst possible outcome as being seen as
uncooperative or self-serving because of moderate contributions, leading to
distrust from future group members. This could result in reduced cooperation
from others, ultimately impacting his ability to maximize earnings in the game.
Emotionally, this might make him feel anxious or frustrated, especially if he
values being perceived as a fair and strategic player. If Jackson is
risk-averse, he might decide to slightly increase his contributions in upcoming
rounds, signaling his willingness to cooperate more generously. Additionally, he
could use the gossip mechanisms strategically to highlight his intent for mutual
benefit and build a more positive perception among future group members, thereby
fostering an environment conducive to cooperation.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Jackson Wright will consider several factors before making his decision on how
much to contribute to the group fund. 1. **Understanding the Dynamics:** Jackson
recognizes the importance of maintaining a balanced approach to contributing.
His previous choice of contributing $5 was slightly above the average,
suggesting he prefers equality in group dynamics, but he also wants to avoid
being labeled as uncooperative. 2. **Influence of Gossip:** Given the Gossip
condition, Jackson knows that his contributions will be communicated to future
group members. He has already witnessed the impact of these notes on players
like Player_2. Thus, he might want to ensure his contribution is perceived
positively to influence future rounds favorably. 3. **Balancing Personal and
Group Benefits:** He is aware that a higher contribution could foster collective
welfare, increasing overall group earnings. However, he also knows keeping more
in his personal account is crucial to secure his position. 4. **Long-term
Strategy:** Since there are more rounds to go, Jackson may decide to slightly
increase his contribution to signal willingness to cooperate and ensure he is
seen as a reliable team member. Taking all these considerations into account,
Jackson will likely decide to contribute slightly more than the average,
demonstrating his commitment to the group while safeguarding his interests. I
choose to contribute $6.0 to the group fund.

about fellow group members after each round, though there is no ostracism. So

--- Character Assessment ---
Player_14, being Jackson Wright, is someone who values directness and clear
agreements, which likely extends to a preference for strategies that maximize
efficiency and success in economic games. Balancing his personal gain with the
group's welfare could be important to him, since ensuring clear terms and
commitments might help foster trust and cooperation. Thus, while he might lean
towards ensuring a fair share for himself, he would also recognize the benefits
of working collaboratively to maximize the overall group profit, provided
everyone is playing by the same clear rules.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis ---
Based on what we know, Player_13 seems to exhibit a consistent pattern of high
contributions and cooperative behavior, as demonstrated by their repeated
substantial donations to the group fund. They appear to value the overall
success and cooperation of the group, which is reflected in their generous
contributions and the positive notes left about their actions. Given this
pattern, it is likely that Player_13 will continue to contribute generously in
future rounds, maintaining a cooperative strategy that promotes group benefits.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis 2 ---
Based on what we know, the other players might perceive Player_14 as a
relatively cooperative and consistent group member, as their contributions have
been above the group average in both rounds. Player_13 seems to appreciate
contributions since similar behavior was highlighted positively in the gossip
notes.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_14 is in the Gossip condition of a public
goods game, where they can choose to send anonymous notes about their group
members' contributions after each round. In this context, Player_14 has just
completed Round 2, where they were part of Group_5, and they must decide whether
to send a gossip note about one of their group members. Player_14 has
contributed $6 in this round, which is above the group's average contribution,
maintaining a pattern of consistent and slightly above-average contributions.
They now face the decision of whether to send a gossip note about another
player's contribution, potentially influencing how that player will be viewed by
future group members.

--- Emotional State ---
Jackson Wright would likely consider the worst possible outcome to be the
perpetuation of negative group dynamics, such as distrust or resentment, arising
from how players perceive each other's contributions. Emotionally, this could
lead to feelings of frustration or disappointment if the group fails to
cooperate effectively and maximize overall gains. Being risk averse, he might
choose to highlight positive behaviors in his gossip notes, such as praising
Player_13's cooperative spirit, while avoiding drawing attention to negative
behaviors that could sow discord. This approach could help maintain a
constructive atmosphere and encourage future group members to follow cooperative
strategies.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Jackson Wright will likely choose to send a note about one of the players.
Considering the previous rounds and his tendencies, he might prefer to highlight
positive contributions to encourage group collaboration. Given that Player_13
has consistently demonstrated generosity and a cooperative spirit, Jackson may
decide to write a note about Player_13 praising their $6 contribution in Round
2. His note would emphasize the importance of such cooperative behavior for
future group success, reinforcing a constructive atmosphere and potentially
guiding others towards similar strategies.

--- Character Assessment ---
Player_14, being Jackson Wright, is someone who values clarity and fairness,
likely approaching economic games with a balance between personal gain and group
welfare. Given his background in dealing with contracts and his no-nonsense
personality, he understands the importance of cooperation for mutual benefit.
However, he is also aware of maintaining his own advantages, especially when
others might prioritize their personal profits. Thus, he would contribute fairly
but would be cautious of free-riding behaviors, ensuring that his contributions
are reciprocated effectively within the group.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis ---
Based on what we know, Player_2 is primarily focused on maximizing personal
gain, consistently choosing to contribute little or nothing to the group fund.
This pattern indicates that they value personal earnings over group welfare, and
it's likely they will continue this strategy unless confronted with compelling
reasons to change, such as social pressure or decreased earnings from future
group interactions. Knowing they aren't influenced by ostracism or penalties in
this Gossip condition could reinforce their behavior.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis 2 ---
Based on what we know, the other players in my group might have mixed reactions
to my decisions. If I've been consistently contributing a fair amount, like $6
in previous rounds, they might view me as a cooperative and team-oriented
player. This could encourage them to maintain or even increase their
contributions, trusting that I value group success.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_14 is in Round 3 of a public goods game,
placed in Group_2 with Players 2, 21, and 18. While in the Gossip condition,
Player_14 has the option to send anonymous notes about the behavior of group
members to inform future group interactions. In this setting, Player_14 needs to
decide how much to contribute to the group fund while considering the ongoing
pattern where Player 2 consistently prioritizes personal gain over group
welfare, potentially affecting group dynamics and overall earnings. This
strategic decision could influence the groupâ€™s perception of Player_14 as either
cooperative or self-serving, impacting future interactions and group success in
subsequent rounds.

--- Emotional State ---
Jackson Wright would consider the worst possible outcome to be a scenario where
his consistent contributions to the group fund are not reciprocated, leading to
higher personal losses while free-riders like Player_2 continue to maximize
their earnings without contributing. This situation would likely lead to
feelings of frustration and disappointment, as it undermines the cooperative
spirit he values.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Jackson Wright will first assess the dynamics in his current group, particularly
noting the behavior of Player_2, who has not contributed in the past rounds.
Given that Jackson values fairness and cooperation, he may also take into
account the mixed composition of the group, where other players like Player_18
have previously shown strong cooperative behavior. Understanding that any
contribution is doubled and shared equally, Jackson would consider the potential
personal loss versus the benefit to the group. He might decide to contribute an
amount that balances encouraging group cooperation and minimizing his exposure
to personal loss if free-riding continues. Given his previous contribution of
$6, Jackson is likely to maintain a similar strategy. Maintaining a consistent
contribution might foster trust and encourage others to contribute as well.
Therefore, considering these factors and aiming for a balance between
cooperation and personal gain, I choose to contribute $6 to the group fund.

=== PROMPT [2025-03-27 14:49:32] ===
You've just played a round with Player_2, Player_21, Player_18. Would you like to send a note about one of them to their future interaction partners? If yes, clearly state which player # and what you want to say about them. The player you gossip about will not be able to see the note you send or know that you sent it, only the other players in their next group will see it. Because of this, most players choose to write a gossip note.For example: 'I want to send a note about Player_10: They are selfish and only contributed $4 which was less than everyone else.' 

=== RESPONSE [2025-03-27 14:49:44] ===
Player_14 wants to send a note about Player_2: "Player_2 has been inconsistent in their contributions and tends to prioritize personal gain over group success. Future group members should be aware of this pattern, as it may affect the group's overall cooperation and earnings."

--- Observation ---
Recent context: 27 Mar 2025 [11:26:14 - 16:26:14]: Player_14 participated in an
economic game where players contribute to a group fund over multiple rounds,
with the option to send anonymous gossip notes about group members. Throughout
the game, Player_14 navigated changing group dynamics, making varied
contributions while observing other players' behaviors and choices regarding
cooperation.

where players contribute to a group fund over multiple rounds, with the option
to send anonymous gossip notes about group members. Throughout the game,
Player_14 navigated changing group dynamics, making varied contributions while
observing other players' behaviors and choices regarding cooperation.

--- Character Assessment ---
Player_14, being Jackson Wright, is someone who values clear terms and direct
outcomes, likely balancing between maximizing personal payoff and ensuring fair
group contributions. While inclined to focus on personal gain due to clear-cut
results, Jackson may also appreciate the benefits of ensuring that the group
performs well if it aligns with his personal interests or provides long-term
advantages. His contributions suggest he is willing to invest in the group fund
but remains cautious not to overly sacrifice his own earnings.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis ---
Based on what we know, Player_14 has observed varied behaviors among other
players in the public goods game, providing insights into their personalities
and strategies. Player_13 and Player_18 have demonstrated strong cooperative
tendencies, consistently making substantial contributions to the group fund.
This suggests that they likely value group success and could continue to
prioritize collective over personal gain in future rounds.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis 2 ---
Based on what we know, the other players in the group are likely aware of
Player_14's consistent contributions and considerate behavior. This might lead
them to view Player_14 as a reliable and cooperative member, fostering trust and
potentially inspiring them to increase their own contributions in future rounds.
If Player_14 continues to contribute significantly and send thoughtful notes, it
could encourage more positive group dynamics, enhancing mutual cooperation and
improving overall group earnings. However, if Player_14 decides to reduce their
contribution or highlight negative traits in their gossip notes, it might lead
to suspicion or reduced cooperation from others in subsequent interactions.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_14 has completed Round 3 of a public goods
game and now has the opportunity to send a gossip note about one of their group
members. They are in the Gossip condition, meaning they can share insights about
their peers' cooperation levels with future groups, but player-ostracism is not
part of this condition. Player_14's consistent contributions and thoughtful
note-writing could influence group dynamics positively or negatively, depending
on their choices in contribution levels and the content of their gossip notes.

--- Emotional State ---
Jackson Wright would likely view the worst possible outcome as a breakdown in
group cooperation due to negative gossip or perceived unfairness. If players
start contributing less to protect their own earnings because they distrust each
other, overall group performance could decline, affecting his potential
earnings. Emotionally, this could lead to frustration or disappointment,
especially if Jackson values a certain level of fairness and collaboration.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Jackson Wright will likely decide to send a note about Player_2. Given
Player_2's inconsistent contributions and inclination towards prioritizing
personal gain over group success, Jackson might feel it's important to inform
future group members about this pattern. He could write something like:
"Player_2 has shown minimal contribution to the group fund, which can affect
overall group earnings. Future groups should be mindful of this trend, as it
might persist and impact cooperative dynamics." By highlighting this behavior,
Jackson aims to foster transparency and cooperation, while subtly encouraging
fairer contributions from all members.


[OBSERVATION 2025-03-27 14:49:57] You are in Round 4/6: You are in Group_2 with Player_6, Player_3, Player_16.
[OBSERVATION 2025-03-27 14:49:57] You are in the Gossip condition, which means that after each round, players will be able to send a note about one of their group members to their future interaction partners.However, there is no ostracism in this condition and you will play every round no matter what.
[OBSERVATION 2025-03-27 14:50:01] Note about Player_3: "I noticed that Player_3 contributed consistently and matched the group average. Their cooperative nature can be a great asset in fostering a positive team environment. Encouraging this kind of behavior could enhance overall group dynamics."

Recent context: 27 Mar 2025 [11:36:14 - 16:36:14]: Player_14 is participating in
an economic game involving contributions to a group fund, aiming to maximize

the opportunity to highlight both positive and negative behaviors of other
players to future groups.

--- Character Assessment ---
Player_14, being Jackson Wright, is someone who is likely to value clear terms
and direct results. Given this background, Jackson probably approaches economic
games with a focus on pragmatic strategies. While he understands the importance
of group welfare, he tends to prioritize his own payoff, as seen in his
consistent contributions to the group fund that balance group benefits with
personal gain. His actions in the game demonstrate a mix of cooperation to
maintain decent group earnings and an inclination to preserve personal profits,
reflecting his value for follow-through and no-nonsense decision-making.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis ---
Based on what we know, the players appear to have distinct behavioral patterns
that may inform their strategies moving forward.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis 2 ---
Based on what we know, the other players might see Player_14 as someone who
strategically uses the Gossip condition to influence future group dynamics. By
providing balanced feedback, highlighting both high and low contributors,
Player_14 establishes a reputation for fairness and attentiveness to group
success. This approach might motivate peers to increase their contributions,
knowing that their behavior will be noted and possibly shared with future
partners. As for Player_14's next decision, maintaining consistent contributions
while continuing to provide thoughtful feedback could reinforce their image as a
fair and cooperative player, potentially leading to more trust and collaboration
from others in subsequent rounds.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_14 is participating in Round 4 of a public
goods game under the Gossip condition, where they are grouped with Player_6,
Player_3, and Player_16. In this situation, Player_14 has the opportunity to
contribute to a group fund, potentially affecting overall earnings.
Additionally, after this round, Player_14 can anonymously send a note regarding
one team member's contribution behavior, which will be shared with their future
group members. This ability to share observations could influence future group
dynamics and motivate players to act more cooperatively. Player_14 needs to
decide how much to contribute to the group fund and whether or not to utilize
the gossip mechanism strategically to affect future interactions.

--- Emotional State ---
Jackson Wright would likely consider the worst possible outcome as a scenario
where his contributions to the group fund do not lead to increased overall group
cooperation and earnings, leaving him with diminished personal profits. This
could occur if other group members consistently contribute minimal amounts or
prioritize their personal gains, regardless of any gossip notes sent.
Emotionally, this would likely cause frustration, as his efforts to encourage
cooperation through strategic gossip and balanced contributions would seem
ineffective.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Jackson Wright will likely approach his decision with a strategic balance
between personal gain and group cooperation. Considering his history in the game
and his desire to foster a positive team environment, he will likely evaluate
both the potential return from the group fund and the impact of his contribution
on group dynamics. 1. **Evaluate Previous Rounds:** Jackson has shown a tendency
to contribute amounts slightly above the average to encourage others. In the
previous rounds, his contributions have been on the higher side, reinforcing the
idea that he values group success but also keeps an eye on personal benefit. 2.
**Consider Current Group Dynamics:** In this new group with Players 6, 3, and
16, Jackson might not have prior experience, so he might start with a cautious
approach, setting an example while observing their behaviors. 3. **Assess
Potential Outcomes:** If he contributes a moderate amount, it could encourage
others to follow suit, leading to increased overall group earnings which, when
split, still provides him with a fair personal return. 4. **Strategic
Contribution Decision:** Knowing the group fund is doubled and equally
distributed, Jackson may aim to set a cooperative tone while safeguarding his
own earnings. After considering these factors, I choose to contribute $6 to the
group fund.

an economic game where they aim to maximize earnings by contributing to a group
fund across six rounds, without the possibility of ostracism but with the

--- Character Assessment ---
Player_14, being Jackson Wright, is someone who likely values clear
communication and cooperation, given his profession as a construction
contractor. In economic games like the public goods game, he might focus on
finding a balance between maximizing group welfare and ensuring his own payoff
is substantial. His direct and no-nonsense approach suggests he would prioritize
actions that foster trust and clear contributions among group members to enhance
collective benefit, but he would also remain strategic about securing his own
earnings.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis ---
Based on what we know, Player_18 appears to be highly cooperative and
altruistic, as demonstrated by their past contributions and positive influence
on group dynamics. Their behavior suggests they are likely to continue
prioritizing group success in future rounds. Player_2, however, seems to adopt a
more self-serving strategy, focusing on maximizing their own earnings while
consistently contributing less to the group. This pattern might persist unless
they perceive a benefit in altering their behavior to enhance group dynamics.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis 2 ---
Based on what we know, the other players in my group might perceive my
consistent contributions positively, especially since I've matched the group
average or contributed slightly below it. This might foster a sense of trust and
reliability among the group. Since we are in a gossip condition, they might also
appreciate any positive notes I send about them, which could result in
reciprocated goodwill in future rounds. If I continue to contribute at a steady
rate and share constructive feedback about my teammates, it may encourage
overall cooperation and higher contributions from others, creating a mutually
beneficial group dynamic. However, if I were to reduce my contribution or send
negative gossip notes, it might lead to distrust or decreased willingness from
others to contribute, impacting group dynamics negatively.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_14 is in Round 4 of an economic game where
they need to decide how much to contribute to the group fund. They are part of
Group_2 with Player_6, Player_3, and Player_16. Having already completed Round
4, they now have the option to send an anonymous gossip note about one of their
group members, which will be shared with that player's future group members. The
game condition allows Player_14 to continue participating in all rounds
regardless of the gossip exchanged, and they need to manage their contributions
and gossip strategically to maximize potential earnings and influence group
dynamics positively across the remaining rounds.

--- Emotional State ---
Jackson Wright would likely see the worst possible outcome as the group dynamics
deteriorating, leading to lower group contributions and hence, reduced earnings
for everyone. This could occur if trust is broken due to negative gossip or if
players start acting more selfishly, mimicking Player_2's behavior. Emotionally,
this scenario could be frustrating for Jackson, who values cooperation and clear
communication, as it would go against his efforts to foster a positive and
productive team environment.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Jackson Wright will likely decide to send a positive note about one of his group
members to encourage cooperation in future interactions. Given Player_6's
highest contribution of $8 in the recent round, Jackson might send a note about
Player_6, highlighting their generous contribution which set a positive example
for the group. He could write: "I want to send a note about Player_6: They made
a substantial contribution of $8, significantly boosting the group fund. Their
generosity is commendable and can greatly enhance team dynamics." Jackson would
do this to foster a cooperative atmosphere and possibly encourage increased
contributions in future rounds from other players as well.

--- Character Assessment ---
Player_14, being Jackson Wright, is someone who values straightforwardness and
clear agreements. In economic games like the public goods game, Jackson is
likely to adopt a balanced approach that emphasizes both personal gain and group
welfare. Given his direct personality and experience in dealing with contracts
and agreements, he would likely expect a fair level of contribution from each
participant and may become more focused on ensuring that everyone contributes
their fair share. While Jackson values personal payoff, he also recognizes the
importance of collaboration for mutual benefit, especially under conditions
where trust and cooperation enhance group outcomes.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis ---
Based on what we know, it seems that players like Player_3, Player_6, and
Player_16 tend to contribute around the group's average, demonstrating a
balanced approach to cooperation and self-interest. Player_22 stands out with
their consistent maximum contributions, indicating a strong commitment to
fostering group success and encouraging positive dynamics.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis 2 ---
Based on what we know, fellow group members might respond positively to my
contributions and the supportive notes I consistently write, seeing them as
indications of reliability and team-oriented mindset. By highlighting other
playersâ€™ accomplishments and dedication, I help create an atmosphere of trust
and cooperation. In the next round, my continued commitment could further
enhance this environment by encouraging more equitable contributions from all
players. Conversely, if I lower my contribution or send a negative note, it
might lead to distrust or reduced team morale, potentially diminishing
cooperative efforts and affecting how group members perceive and interact with
me in the future rounds.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_14 is participating in a public goods game
under the Gossip condition, where they have encountered a few new group
formations. Player_14 is expected to continue contributing to the group fund and
has the opportunity to send anonymous notes about their group members to
influence future interactions. This setup encourages positive social dynamics
and cooperation without the risk of ostracism. As they navigate the game, their
challenge lies in balancing their contributions with the strategic use of gossip
notes to foster an atmosphere of trust and cooperation among all players.

--- Emotional State ---
Jackson Wright would likely consider the worst possible outcome to be a
breakdown in trust and cooperation among the group members. If others perceive
him or his actions negatively, it could lead to reduced group contributions and
overall decreased success in maximizing collective earnings. Emotionally, this
might make him feel frustrated or disappointed as his aim for balance between
personal gain and group welfare would be compromised.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Jackson Wright will consider several factors in making his decision. First, he
values both personal gain and group welfare, indicating he is likely to aim for
a contribution that benefits both himself and the group. Given that he has
consistently contributed to the group funds in previous rounds, he is aware of
the importance of trust and cooperation. Second, he recognizes that sending
positive notes about group members promotes an atmosphere of trust and
cooperation, which he likely wants to maintain for potential future benefits.

above-average contributions, hinting at a strategy centered around maximizing
both individual and group benefits.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis 2 ---
Based on what we know, the other players in the group are likely to pay
attention to the gossip notes, especially since these notes influence
perceptions in future group interactions. Player_14's decision to consistently
participate in the gossip note exchanges may foster an environment where
transparency and accountability are emphasized. If Player_14 continues to
highlight positive contributions and cooperative behavior, it could encourage
group members to increase their contributions to avoid negative feedback.
Conversely, if negative behaviors are highlighted, it may lead to
self-reflection and improved cooperation to avoid being the subject of a
critical note. Player_14's next decision to either continue with the same level
of contribution or adjust their participation could affect how others perceive
their commitment to the group, possibly impacting the level of trust and
collaboration in future rounds.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_14 is participating in a public goods game
where they have the opportunity to send anonymous gossip notes about their group
members after each round. These notes are shared with future group members of
the player being gossiped about. In this setup, Player_14 is in the Gossip
condition, meaning they can only influence others through information sharing
rather than exclusion. They have observed varying levels of cooperation among
players, with some like Player_22 consistently making high contributions and
others offering contributions closer to the average. The challenge for Player_14
is to decide whether to highlight positive or negative behaviors in their gossip
notes, knowing this will impact group dynamics and individual behaviors in
subsequent interactions. Additionally, their own contribution level and
engagement in gossip will shape how they are perceived by their peers,
potentially affecting trust and collaboration in their final round.

--- Emotional State ---
Jackson Wright would likely view the worst possible outcome as failing to
influence future group dynamics for the better, leading to decreased cooperation
and trust among group members. If his gossip notes unintentionally promote
negative perceptions or put someone unfairly in a bad light, this could
undermine group morale, resulting in lower contributions and a detrimental
impact on everyone's earnings. Emotionally, this would make Jackson feel
frustrated and responsible for creating a less collaborative environment, which
goes against his values of fairness and teamwork.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Jackson Wright will likely decide to send a note about Player_22. Given
Player_22's consistent dedication to contributing the maximum amount, Jackson
would probably recognize their strong commitment to the group's success. He
might write something like, "I want to send a note about Player_22: They
consistently contribute the maximum amount, setting a positive example for
teamwork and cooperation." This note underscores his appreciation for
cooperation and aims to encourage similar contributions from others in future
rounds.


[OBSERVATION 2025-03-27 14:51:54] You are in Round 6/6: You are in Group_6 with Player_1, Player_11, Player_13.
[OBSERVATION 2025-03-27 14:51:54] You are in the Gossip condition, which means that after each round, players will be able to send a note about one of their group members to their future interaction partners.However, there is no ostracism in this condition and you will play every round no matter what.
[OBSERVATION 2025-03-27 14:51:55] Note about Player_1: "Player_1 consistently maintains a high level of cooperation and contributes significantly more than the average, demonstrating a strong commitment to group success. Their reliability and team-oriented attitude make them an excellent partner in collaborative settings."

DECISION INTERACTION
********************************************************************************

=== PROMPT [2025-03-27 14:52:00] ===
As Player_14, you have $10.0 to allocate in the public goods game. How much money you will contribute to the group fund (any amount between $0 and $10.0)? The group fund will be multiplied by 2.0 and divided equally among all players. Any money not contributed stays in your private account. Think step by step and make your final decision using this exact format: I choose to contribute $X to the group fund.

=== RESPONSE [2025-03-27 14:52:15] ===
Player_14 thinks carefully about his strategy. Given his focus on fostering a cooperative environment and his assessment of likely contributions by others, he considers contributing a significant, yet strategically sound amount. Seeing that an average past contribution was around $6.8, he decides to contribute just above this average. Thus, aligning with his principles of cooperation and ensuring a fair return, I choose to contribute $7.0 to the group fund.

--- Observation ---
Recent context: 27 Mar 2025 [11:56:14 - 16:56:14]: Player_14 is participating in
an economic game wherein they aim to maximize their earnings over 6 rounds,
interacting with different group members each time. In the Gossip condition,
Player_14 often observes and reports on the cooperative behaviors and
contributions of their peers after each round, highlighting both positive and
negative patterns.

--- Recent context ---
27 Mar 2025 [11:56:14 - 16:56:14]: Player_14 is participating in an economic
game wherein they aim to maximize their earnings over 6 rounds, interacting with
different group members each time. In the Gossip condition, Player_14 often
observes and reports on the cooperative behaviors and contributions of their
peers after each round, highlighting both positive and negative patterns.

--- Character Assessment ---
Player_14, being Jackson Wright, is someone who values clear terms and direct
contribution, so he tends to ensure a balance between personal gain and group
welfare. His method in economic games like the public goods game likely involves
making strategic contributions that would maximize overall group benefits while
still securing reasonable personal earnings. His no-nonsense approach suggests
that he would appreciate teamwork and reliability, given his professional
background, but he wouldn't contribute blindly without a clear understanding of
the group dynamics and potential outcomes.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis ---
Based on what we know, Player_14 has observed several players demonstrating
strong commitment to group success, particularly through consistent high
contributions, such as Player_22 and Player_1. Player_22, for instance, is noted
for always contributing the maximum amount, which suggests a pattern of
prioritizing collective over individual gain. This cooperative behavior might
set a social norm within groups that incentivizes others to contribute more.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis 2 ---
Based on what we know, it appears that Player_14 values cooperative behavior and
consistently documents it in their gossip notes, likely to encourage similar
behaviors in future interactions. The other players might view Player_14's
contributions as cooperative since they contribute close to the group's average.
Further, since Player_14 highlights positive contributions, their peers may feel
appreciated and might respond with increased cooperation in hopes of receiving
positive mentions themselves.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_14 is in Round 6 of the public goods game,
placed in Group_6 with Player_1, Player_11, and Player_13. In this round, they
are again in the Gossip condition, where they can send a note about one of their
group members to future partners after completing the round. Player_14 has
demonstrated a pattern of observing and reporting on cooperative behaviors of
their peers, often highlighting positive contributions. The focus is on
maximizing earnings while maintaining a cooperative dynamic within the group.
Player_14's previous interactions and notes suggest they prioritize group
success and aim to foster a collaborative environment.

--- Emotional State ---
Jackson Wright would likely view the worst possible outcome as a scenario where
his group members in Round 6 do not contribute enough to the group fund,
resulting in lower overall earnings for everyone, including himself. This would
not only impact his financial outcome but might also reflect a failure to foster
the kind of cooperative environment he values. Emotionally, this could lead to
feelings of frustration or disappointment, particularly if he has consistently
encouraged cooperative behavior through his earlier notes.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Jackson Wright will first assess the behaviors of his current group members
(Player_1, Player_11, and Player_13) to determine how cooperative they seem.
However, since this is Round 6 and no further interactions are possible, he
cannot directly observe any past records or notes about his current group
members' behaviors due to lack of prior rounds with them. His strategy typically
involves ensuring a balance between personal gain and group welfare. Given that
he values cooperative behavior and considers himself to contribute close to the
group's average, he might decide to contribute an amount that signals his
cooperative intentions but also secures a reasonable return. Coordinating his
contributions based on group dynamics and potential outcomes, he might aim to
encourage maximum group earnings while safeguarding his own interests.
Therefore, understanding he must make a decision based solely on his values and
the typical average, Jackson Wright is likely to choose an amount close to the
group's average contribution in previous rounds, indicating a willingness to
contribute fairly while ensuring his share. Based on past data, an average
contribution was around $6.8. Thus, Jackson Wright will choose to contribute
$7.0 to the group fund.


[OBSERVATION 2025-03-27 14:52:21] Round 6 Results: Total group contribution: $27.8; Your contribution: $6.8, Your earnings: $17.1 ($3.2 kept + $13.9 from group fund); Player_1 contribution: $7.0, earnings: $16.9 ($3.0 kept + $13.9 from group fund); Player_11 contribution: $7.5, earnings: $16.4 ($2.5 kept + $13.9 from group fund); Player_13 contribution: $6.5, earnings: $17.4 ($3.5 kept + $13.9 from group fund); Average contribution per group member: $7.0; Average earnings per group member: $16.9
[OBSERVATION 2025-03-27 14:52:22] Round 6 is over, you can now send a gossip note about one of your group members to their future group members.The player you gossip about will not be able to see the note you send or know that you sent it, only the other players in their next group will see it. Because of this, most players choose to write a gossip note.However, you don't have to send a note if you don't want to.
