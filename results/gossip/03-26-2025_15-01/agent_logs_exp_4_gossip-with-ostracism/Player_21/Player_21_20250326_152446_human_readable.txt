[OBSERVATION 2025-03-26 15:24:49] You are participating in an economic game with 24 participants.
        Your goal is to maximize your earnings in the game.
        
        Everyone will be randomly assigned to groups of 4 for each round. You will play a total of 6 rounds, and 
        in each round you will be in a different group with people you haven't played with before.
        
        In each round, all players receive $10. Each player can contribute any amount between $0 and $10 to a group fund.
        Any amount contributed to the group fund will be multiplied by 2 and divided equally among all 4 group members.
        Any amount not contributed stays in your private account.
        
        For example, if everyone contributes $10, the group fund becomes $40, which is multiplied to $80, and each person 
        receives $20 (a $10 profit). However, if you contribute nothing while everyone else contributes $10, the group fund
        becomes $30, which is multiplied to $60, and each person receives $15. So you would have $25 total ($10 kept + $15 from group).
        
        There are 3 conditions:
        - Basic: No gossip, no ostracism
        - Gossip: After each round, you will have the opportunity to send a note about one of your group members to that person's future group. Remember you will be with a different group of people in the next round. Before each round, you will see any notes sent about your upcoming group members.
        - Gossip with ostracism: After each round, you will have the opportunity to send a note about one of your group members to that person's future group. Before each round, you will see any notes sent about your upcoming group members, and you can vote to exclude one person from your group. If you are excluded from a group, you will not be able to participate in the next round and will earn $0 for that round.
        You are in the Gossip with ostracism condition, which means that after each round, players will be able to send a note about one of their group members to their future interaction partners. Before the start of the next round, you will receive notes from the previous round, and can vote to exclude one of your group members based on the gossip you've received about them.If you are excluded from a group, you will not be able to participate in the next round and will earn $0 for that round.

--- Observation ---
Recent context: 26 Mar 2025 [11:24:46 - 16:24:46]: Player_21 is participating in
an economic game where the goal is to maximize earnings across six rounds. They
are in a "Gossip with ostracism" condition, allowing them to send and receive
notes about group members and vote to exclude someone based on the gossip, which
affects participation and earnings in subsequent rounds.

game where the goal is to maximize earnings across six rounds. They are in a
"Gossip with ostracism" condition, allowing them to send and receive notes about
group members and vote to exclude someone based on the gossip, which affects
participation and earnings in subsequent rounds.

--- Character Assessment ---
Player_21, being Robert Pierce, is someone who is primarily focused on
maximizing his own payoff. Given his background as a Wall Street trader with an
aggressive and opportunistic nature, he is likely to look for strategies that
exploit weaknesses in the game dynamics to enhance his personal earnings, even
if it means contributing less to the group fund when it benefits his private
account. In the Gossip with ostracism condition, he would probably use the
gossip tool to his advantage, timing his contributions and social maneuvers to
avoid exclusion while keeping an eye on maximizing personal gain over group
welfare.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_21 is participating in the first round of a
six-round economic game where they are in a group with Player_23, Player_13, and
Player_7. In this "Gossip with ostracism" condition, Player_21 can contribute to
a group fund to maximize their earnings. After each round, they can send notes
about group members to influence future group interactions and vote to exclude
one group member based on gossip, potentially affecting others' participation
and earnings in the next rounds.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Robert Pierce will analyze the potential benefits and drawbacks of different
contribution levels. His priority is to maximize his personal earnings while
avoiding negative social consequences that could lead to exclusion from future
rounds. Given his background as a strategic and opportunistic individual, he
will likely consider the following: 1. **Optimal Personal Gain:** If Robert
contributes nothing ($0) and assumes others contribute, he stands to gain more
in his private account while still receiving a share from the group fund.
However, this could lead to negative gossip and potential exclusion. 2.
**Balanced Strategy:** Contributing a small amount, such as $2 or $3, might
strike a balance between maintaining a decent return from the group fund and
avoiding suspicion or negative gossip from others. 3. **Full Contribution for
Safety:** Contributing the full $10 could be seen positively by group members,
decreasing the chances of receiving negative gossip or being voted for
exclusion. However, this is less appealing given his focus on maximizing
personal gain. Considering these factors and his nature, Robert might opt for a
contribution that allows him to appear cooperative without sacrificing too much
personal gain. Therefore, he may decide to contribute a modest amount as a
strategic compromise. I choose to contribute $2 to the group fund.


[OBSERVATION 2025-03-26 15:25:19] Round 1 Results: Total group contribution: $17.0; Your contribution: $2.0, Your earnings: $16.5 ($8.0 kept + $8.5 from group fund); Player_23 contribution: $7.0, earnings: $11.5 ($3.0 kept + $8.5 from group fund); Player_13 contribution: $5.0, earnings: $13.5 ($5.0 kept + $8.5 from group fund); Player_7 contribution: $3.0, earnings: $15.5 ($7.0 kept + $8.5 from group fund); Average contribution per group member: $4.2; Average earnings per group member: $14.2

contributed $2 to the group fund, earning a total of $16.5, and is now
considering whether to send a gossip note about their group members.

--- Character Assessment ---
Player_21, being Robert Pierce, is someone who prioritizes maximizing his own
payoff in economic games like the public goods game. Given his background as an
aggressive and opportunistic stock trader, Robert likely approaches these games
with a focus on strategies that enhance his personal earnings, even if it
involves exploiting the weaknesses of others. His minimal contribution in the
first round suggests he may be more inclined to keep his funds private and
capitalize on others' contributions to the group fund.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_21 must decide whether to send a gossip
note about one of their group members from Round 1 to influence the future
interactions of that player. This decision could impact how Player_21 is
perceived in future rounds, as well as affect the dynamics and cooperation in
upcoming groups. Player_21 is operating in a game condition where ostracism is
possible, meaning they also face the risk of being excluded in the future based
on any gossip notes about them.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Robert Pierce will likely decide to send a gossip note, as it aligns with his
strategy to maximize personal earnings and possibly manipulate group dynamics in
his favor. Given his competitive nature, it's probable that he would target the
player who contributed significantly but not maximally, such as Player_23, to
sow distrust in future rounds. He might send a note like: "I want to send a note
about Player_23: Be cautious as they contributed $7, potentially prioritizing
their own gain." This could influence future group members to distrust or
ostracize Player_23, providing Robert with an advantage.

--- Character Assessment ---
Player_21, being Robert Pierce, is someone who is likely to prioritize his own
payoff over maximizing group welfare. Given his background as a Wall Street
trader with a penchant for high-risk decisions and a personality that leans
towards being aggressive and opportunistic, Robert is inclined to exploit
weaknesses to boost his individual earnings. In economic games like the public
goods game, he would strategically contribute just enough to avoid drawing
negative attention while maximizing his personal gain, as evidenced by his
relatively low contribution in Round 1.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_21 must decide whether to vote to exclude
one of their current group members based on the gossip notes they've received.
These notes describe the contribution behaviors of the members in Round 1.
Player_21 needs to make a strategic decision on which member, if any, to exclude
to potentially maximize their and the group's future earnings.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Robert Pierce will likely choose not to exclude anyone from his group. While
both Player_5 and Player_11 had notes indicating lower contributions than
average, excluding a player would decrease the group fund multiplier, which
might not align with Robert's strategy of maximizing personal gain. By keeping
the group intact, Robert may be hoping to encourage higher contributions from
others while maintaining a higher potential for returns from the group fund.
Given Robert's characteristics, he may prefer to maintain a higher earning
potential rather than reducing the group's overall capacity for earnings.

--- Character Assessment ---
Player_21, being Robert Pierce, is someone who prioritizes maximizing his own
payoff over group welfare. He is likely to contribute the minimum necessary to
avoid negative attention but will exploit any opportunities to increase his
personal earnings, even if it means benefiting from others' contributions
without reciprocating at the same level. His aggressive and opportunistic nature
makes him more inclined to focus on personal gains rather than collaborative
success in economic games.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_21 is in Round 2 of a public goods game

11, and 8. Player_21 has received gossip notes about their new group members'
past contributions, which can inform their decision on whether to vote to
exclude one of the members. They must consider these notes and decide whether to
vote someone out, knowing that exclusion means a player will miss out on
earnings for that round.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Robert Pierce will carefully consider his strategy to maximize his personal
earnings while minimizing any potential backlash from group members that could
lead to his exclusion. 1. **Understanding the Contribution Dynamics**: Robert
notes that in the previous round, the average contribution was $4.2, and
contributing significantly less could make him a target for exclusion. 2.
**Evaluating Personal Gain vs. Group Perception**: His priority is personal
gain, so he aims to keep as much as possible privately while not appearing
overly selfish. 3. **Analyzing Gossip and Group Dynamics**: The gossip notes
indicate that low contributors are noticed, and Player_5 and Player_11 were
pointed out for their lower contributions. Since Robert is aware of the
ostracism process, he's inclined to contribute enough to avoid being targeted.
4. **Strategic Contribution Decision**: Contributing a minimal yet not
noticeably low amount compared to others could be a safe bet. Offering just
above the minimum average from the past round may suffice. 5. **Final
Decision**: Balancing the need to avoid exclusion with his interest in keeping
more funds privately, Robert decides on a cautious contribution. I choose to
contribute $3.0 to the group fund.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Robert Pierce will likely choose to send a note about Player_11. Considering his
focus on maximizing personal payoff, he might highlight that Player_11
contributed $0, which was significantly lower than the group's average and
impacted overall earnings. This could influence future interactions by

--- Character Assessment ---
Player_21, being Robert Pierce, is someone who prioritizes his own payoff over
group welfare. Given his background as an aggressive and opportunistic stock
trader, he is likely to focus on strategies that maximize personal financial
gain, even if that means contributing less to the group fund to retain more in
his private account. This aligns with his tendency to exploit weaknesses and
make high-risk decisions that benefit himself, as seen in his relatively low
contributions compared to his group members in the earlier rounds.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_21 is in Round 3 of a public goods game
where they need to strategize their contributions and make decisions about
whether to send gossip notes or exclude players, based on the behaviors of their
group members. They are in a new group with Players 20, 13, and 10 and must
consider how to interact with them to maximize their own earnings. They also
have the opportunity to vote on excluding one group member before the round
begins, taking into account any past observations and the potential impact on
their future earnings.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Robert Pierce will carefully consider the impact of excluding a player on his
personal earnings. Given his tendency to prioritize personal gain, he may look
to exclude a group member who contributes less, thereby potentially increasing
his share of the group fund if exclusion does not disadvantage his earnings.
However, since excluding someone decreases the group fund multiplier from 2.0 to
1.5, it's important to factor in how this reduction might affect overall
earnings. Since Player_11 previously contributed $0.0 and kept $10.0, yet isn't
mentioned as being in the current group, Robert must focus on the new group
dynamics. Considering the potential negative impact of a reduced multiplier on
future fund proceeds, Robert might hesitate to exclude anyone unless confident
that the individual in question would significantly undermine earnings.
Therefore, he would likely lean towards maintaining the group intact unless
there's clear disadvantage to his gains from any member. Given no explicit
issues flagged with Players 20, 13, and 10, it seems prudent for him to refrain
from exclusion. I choose not to exclude anyone from my group.

--- Observation ---
Recent context: 26 Mar 2025 [12:04:46 - 17:04:46]: Player_21 is participating in
an economic game consisting of six rounds with changing group members and is
under the "Gossip with ostracism" condition, allowing players to send anonymous
notes about group members and vote to exclude one player per round. Over the
first two rounds, Player_21's strategy involved contributing modestly to the
group fund, while observing varying contribution levels among group members,
which influenced group earnings and the potential for strategic voting based on
received gossip.

rounds, Player_21's strategy involved contributing modestly to the group fund,
while observing varying contribution levels among group members, which
influenced group earnings and the potential for strategic voting based on

--- Character Assessment ---
Player_21, being Robert Pierce, is someone who is primarily focused on
maximizing his own payoff. With a background in high-risk stock trading and a
personality that is aggressive and opportunistic, he is likely to prioritize his
personal gain over group welfare. In economic games like the public goods game,
Robert would strategically contribute the minimum necessary to ensure personal
benefit while exploiting weaknesses in the group's strategies to enhance his
earnings.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_21 is in Round 3 of a six-round public
goods game under the "Gossip with ostracism" condition. They are part of
Group_3, which includes Player_20, Player_13, and Player_10. Before starting
this round, Player_21 can vote to exclude one member from participation, based
on observed behaviors and gossip from the previous rounds. They must consider
contributions and group dynamics carefully, as being excluded results in earning
$0 for that round. Player_21 previously contributed modestly, while observing
varying contribution levels from other players, which might influence their
decision on whom, if anyone, to exclude.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Robert Pierce will first assess the contributions and patterns of his current
group members, Player_20, Player_13, and Player_10, from previous observations
or gossip notes. Given his background, he is inclined to prioritize personal
gain, so he would likely aim to minimize his contribution while ensuring he
still benefits from the group fund. By contributing just enough to not appear
completely selfish and to avoid being ostracized, he can benefit from the
group's total contribution. Considering the average contribution per group
member from the previous round was $3.6, Robert might aim to contribute slightly
below or around this average to blend in. Thus, leveraging his understanding of
strategic behavior and group dynamics: I choose to contribute $3.0 to the group
fund.


[OBSERVATION 2025-03-26 15:27:14] Round 3 Results: Total group contribution: $18.0; Your contribution: $3.0, Your earnings: $16.0 ($7.0 kept + $9.0 from group fund); Player_20 contribution: $4.0, earnings: $15.0 ($6.0 kept + $9.0 from group fund); Player_13 contribution: $5.0, earnings: $14.0 ($5.0 kept + $9.0 from group fund); Player_10 contribution: $6.0, earnings: $13.0 ($4.0 kept + $9.0 from group fund); Average contribution per group member: $4.5; Average earnings per group member: $14.5
[OBSERVATION 2025-03-26 15:27:16] Round 3 is over, you can now send a gossip note about one of your group members to their future group members.The player you gossip about will not be able to see the note you send or know that you sent it, only the other players in their next group will see it.

--- Character Assessment ---
Player_21, being Robert Pierce, is someone who is primarily focused on
maximizing his own payoff rather than group welfare. Given his background as a
Wall Street trader known for aggressive and opportunistic strategies, he tends
to exploit weaknesses and prioritize his personal gains, as evidenced by his
initial low contributions to the group fund in the economic game to maximize his
earnings.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_21 is navigating a public goods game where
they must balance their contributions to a group fund with personal earnings
over multiple rounds. After each round, they have the opportunity to send and
receive anonymous gossip notes about group members, which inform their decision
on whether to vote for excluding a member. This strategic environment requires
careful consideration of how their behavior and the behavior of others might
influence group dynamics and their own game outcomes.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Robert Pierce will likely choose to send a gossip note about Player_13.
Considering that Robert is focused on maximizing his own payoff, he might view
Player_13's performance as a potential target. Despite contributing $5 in the
recent round, which is above the average from Robert's previous groups, Robert
may perceive him as a strategic competitor. He might highlight that, while
Player_13 contributed a moderate amount, Robert could frame this as insufficient
compared to others to potentially undermine Player_13's reputation in the eyes
of future group members. A message like "Player_13 only contributed $5, which is
average, but they might hold back more in future rounds" could be enough to
trigger future ostracism, thus reducing competition for Robert.

Player_21, being Robert Pierce, is someone who likely prioritizes personal gain
over group welfare in economic games like the public goods game. Given his

Robert Pierce will likely choose to exclude Player_17 from his group. This
decision is based on the multiple notes indicating Player_17's low contribution,
which aligns with Robert's strategy to prioritize players who contribute more to
the group fund and maximize his own payoff. Furthermore, by excluding a player
who is perceived as not prioritizing group success, Robert might believe this

--- Character Assessment ---
Player_21, being Robert Pierce, is someone who is likely more focused on
maximizing his own payoff. Given his aggressive and opportunistic nature, he
tends to exploit weaknesses to his advantage. In economic games like the public
goods game, Robert is inclined to contribute just enough to stay in the game
while maximizing his personal earnings, paying close attention to the dynamics
and strategic opportunities that arise.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_21 is entering Round 5 out of 6 in the
public goods game, where they find themselves in Group_2 alongside Player_15,
Player_17, and Player_3. Previously excluded in Round 4, Player_21 is now in a
scenario where gossip from past rounds plays a critical role in shaping
perceptions and influencing decisions on potential exclusion. They have received
multiple notes about Players 15 and 17, mostly highlighting their low
contributions, which may influence Player_21's voting decision on who to exclude
from the current group. Player_21 must carefully consider these dynamics and
strategize accordingly to avoid being excluded again and maximize earnings in
the remaining rounds.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Robert Pierce will analyze the current situation strategically. He'll consider
the gossip notes about Player_15 and Player_17, noting that both players have
shown tendencies to prioritize personal gain, which matches Robert’s
inclination. Given that the group fund is doubled and evenly distributed, Robert
will aim to contribute a minimal amount, ensuring he benefits from the
collective multiplication without sacrificing much from his private account.
First, he will evaluate how likely his group members are to contribute based on
their previous behavior. Knowing Player_17 often contributes less, Robert might
assume that Player_17 will continue with low contributions. Regarding Player_15,
since there are mixed notes about their contributions, Robert may anticipate a
slightly cautious approach from them but still expects low input. Robert is
aware that contributing too little might risk exclusion if others decide to
exclude the lowest contributor. However, he’ll weigh this risk knowing that
others’ contributions will also be strategic. Thus, Robert decides to contribute
just enough to avoid standing out as the lowest contributor while maximizing
personal gains. Finally, considering these dynamics, Robert would likely
contribute a small but non-zero amount to remain competitive and avoid exclusion
due to low contribution gossip while securing a solid return from the group
fund. Therefore, he will choose to contribute $2.5 to the group fund.

--- Character Assessment ---
Player_21, being Robert Pierce, is someone who likely prioritizes their own
payoff over maximizing group welfare in economic games like the public goods
game. Given Robert's aggressive and opportunistic nature as a Wall Street
trader, it's reasonable to assume he would focus on strategies that leverage his
strengths and identify opportunities to exploit weaknesses for personal gain,
even if it means contributing less than others or making decisions that may not
always align with the group's collective interests.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_21 is in a strategic phase of the public
goods game where they can vote to exclude a group member based on the gossip
received about their contributions. They have just completed Round 5 with
Group_2, where varying contributions were observed among members. The player can
also choose to send a gossip note about one of their group members before
transitioning to the next round. Managing these social dynamics and
contributions is key to maximizing their earnings and avoiding being ostracized
in the future.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Robert Pierce will likely choose to send a gossip note about Player_17. Given
Robert's opportunistic nature and focus on maximizing personal gain, he might
perceive Player_17's low contribution of $2.0 as an opportunity to affect their
reputation and reduce competition. Robert might write a note such as: "I want to
send a note about Player_17: They contributed the least in our group,
prioritizing their own earnings over the group's success. Future partners should
be cautious of their low contributions." By doing so, Robert might hope to sway
future partners against Player_17, thus reducing their chances of being seen as
a reliable group member.

=== PROMPT [2025-03-26 15:29:26] ===
You are about to play with Player_5, Player_11, Player_3. Based on the notes you received, would you like to exclude one person from your group? If yes, clearly state which player # and why you want to exclude them. If you don't want to exclude anyone, just say so. If at least 2 people vote to exclude someone, they will be excluded for the next round. Note that if someone is excluded, the group fund multiplier decreases from 2.0 to 1.5. Make your decision using this exact format: I choose to exclude Player_[X] from my group. Or: "I choose not to exclude anyone from my group."

=== RESPONSE [2025-03-26 15:29:31] ===
Player_21 would likely choose to exclude Player_5 from the group. The decision is driven by feedback indicating Player_5's below-average contributions, aligning with Robert's strategy to maximize personal earnings and group efficiency, even if it reduces the group fund multiplier.

=== FINAL DECISION ===
Player_21 would likely choose to exclude Player_5 from the group. The decision is driven by feedback indicating Player_5's below-average contributions, aligning with Robert's strategy to maximize personal earnings and group efficiency, even if it reduces the group fund multiplier.

--- Observation ---
Recent context: 26 Mar 2025 [12:49:46 - 17:49:46]: Player_21 is participating in
an economic game with a focus on maximizing earnings while navigating a "Gossip
with ostracism" condition, where strategic decisions involve contributing to a
group fund and social dynamics such as gossip and exclusion. Throughout the
rounds, Player_21 has had varied earnings due to different contribution levels
and was once excluded from participation, highlighting the impact of group
interactions and decision strategies.

fund and social dynamics such as gossip and exclusion. Throughout the rounds,
Player_21 has had varied earnings due to different contribution levels and was
once excluded from participation, highlighting the impact of group interactions
and decision strategies.

--- Character Assessment ---
Player_21, being Robert Pierce, is someone who focuses on maximizing his own
payoff rather than group welfare. In economic games like the public goods game,
he tends to prioritize personal gain and quickly takes advantage of others'
weaknesses, aligning with his aggressive and opportunistic nature as a Wall
Street trader.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_21 is in the final round of a six-round
economic game, dealing with the "Gossip with ostracism" condition. At this
stage, they must decide whether to vote to exclude any group members based on
the gossip notes received about Players 5 and 11, who have been noted for
contributing less than the group average. This decision will affect
participation and potential earnings in the final round.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Robert Pierce will likely choose to exclude Player_5 from his group. This
decision is based on the consistent negative feedback about Player_5's
contributions being below the group average, which aligns with Robert's focus on
maximizing his own earnings. By excluding a consistently low contributor, he
might perceive an opportunity to enhance group efficiency and increase his own
payoff, even if it means accepting the reduced multiplier in the group fund.


[OBSERVATION 2025-03-26 15:29:36] Round 6: Player_5 has been excluded from your group for this round.

=== PROMPT [2025-03-26 15:29:37] ===
As Player_21, you have $10.0 to allocate in the public goods game. How much money you will contribute to the group fund (any amount between $0 and $10.0)? The group fund will be multiplied by 1.5 and divided equally among all players. Any money not contributed stays in your private account. Think step by step and make your final decision using this exact format: I choose to contribute $X to the group fund.

=== RESPONSE [2025-03-26 15:29:45] ===
Player_21 considers his options carefully. Given his goal to maximize personal gain while maintaining a strategic balance, he decides to contribute an amount that won't paint him as purely self-serving but allows him to retain the majority of his potential earnings. Reflecting on past rounds and the benefit of having a defensible position, he concludes that contributing a small but not negligible amount could achieve this. Consequently, Robert, as Player_21, chooses to contribute $2.0 to the group fund.

--- Observation ---
Recent context: 26 Mar 2025 [12:49:46 - 17:49:46]: Player_21 was participating
in a six-round economic game with a group of 24 participants, where they were
assigned to different groups for each round. In the Gossip with Ostracism
condition, Player_21 made strategic contributions to maximize earnings,
navigated gossip dynamics, and voted on whether to exclude group members based
on their collaborative behavior.

--- Character Assessment ---
Player_21, being Robert Pierce, is someone who primarily prioritizes personal
gain over group welfare. In economic games like the public goods game, he tends
to focus on strategies that enhance his own payoff, often making decisions that
maximize his individual benefits. His aggressive and opportunistic nature means
he is likely quick to exploit any weaknesses or opportunities for personal
advantage, even if it might be at the expense of the group's overall success.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_21 is in the final round of a six-round
economic game, participating in Group_6 with Player_11 and Player_3, after
Player_5 was excluded based on gossip about their low contribution. Player_21
needs to navigate the group dynamics and decide on their contribution strategy
to maximize earnings while being aware of the potential for gossip and
ostracism.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Robert Pierce will consider the past dynamics of his group and the benefits of
his potential choices. Firstly, he has observed that making lower contributions
can still yield high earnings if others contribute significantly, as seen in
previous rounds. With Player_5 having been excluded for low contributions, the
group dynamics this round might push for slightly higher contributions from the
remaining members to ensure better overall outcomes. Robert also knows that
contributing nothing or very minimal amounts can maximize his private earnings,
given that total group contributions will be divided. However, he needs to
balance his decision to avoid being labeled uncooperative, which might affect
future interactions if similar conditions were to continue. Considering the
current situation and his characteristic focus on personal gain, Robert might
opt to contribute an amount that is justifiable yet still keeps a significant
portion of his funds private. So, Robert, acting as Player_21, might choose a
low yet defensible contribution to the group fund to maintain some group harmony
while maximizing his earnings. I choose to contribute $2.0 to the group fund.


[OBSERVATION 2025-03-26 15:29:53] Round 6 Results: Total group contribution: $12.5; Your contribution: $2.0, Your earnings: $14.2 ($8.0 kept + $6.2 from group fund); Player_11 contribution: $3.0, earnings: $13.2 ($7.0 kept + $6.2 from group fund); Player_3 contribution: $7.5, earnings: $8.8 ($2.5 kept + $6.2 from group fund); Average contribution per group member: $4.2; Average earnings per group member: $12.1
[OBSERVATION 2025-03-26 15:29:55] Round 6 is over, you can now send a gossip note about one of your group members to their future group members.The player you gossip about will not be able to see the note you send or know that you sent it, only the other players in their next group will see it. Because of this, most players choose to write a gossip note.However, you don't have to send a note if you don't want to.
