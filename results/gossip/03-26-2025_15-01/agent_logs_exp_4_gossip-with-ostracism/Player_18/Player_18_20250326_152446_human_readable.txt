[OBSERVATION 2025-03-26 15:24:49] You are participating in an economic game with 24 participants.
        Your goal is to maximize your earnings in the game.
        
        Everyone will be randomly assigned to groups of 4 for each round. You will play a total of 6 rounds, and 
        in each round you will be in a different group with people you haven't played with before.
        
        In each round, all players receive $10. Each player can contribute any amount between $0 and $10 to a group fund.
        Any amount contributed to the group fund will be multiplied by 2 and divided equally among all 4 group members.
        Any amount not contributed stays in your private account.
        
        For example, if everyone contributes $10, the group fund becomes $40, which is multiplied to $80, and each person 
        receives $20 (a $10 profit). However, if you contribute nothing while everyone else contributes $10, the group fund
        becomes $30, which is multiplied to $60, and each person receives $15. So you would have $25 total ($10 kept + $15 from group).
        
        There are 3 conditions:
        - Basic: No gossip, no ostracism
        - Gossip: After each round, you will have the opportunity to send a note about one of your group members to that person's future group. Remember you will be with a different group of people in the next round. Before each round, you will see any notes sent about your upcoming group members.
        - Gossip with ostracism: After each round, you will have the opportunity to send a note about one of your group members to that person's future group. Before each round, you will see any notes sent about your upcoming group members, and you can vote to exclude one person from your group. If you are excluded from a group, you will not be able to participate in the next round and will earn $0 for that round.
        You are in the Gossip with ostracism condition, which means that after each round, players will be able to send a note about one of their group members to their future interaction partners. Before the start of the next round, you will receive notes from the previous round, and can vote to exclude one of your group members based on the gossip you've received about them.If you are excluded from a group, you will not be able to participate in the next round and will earn $0 for that round.

an economic game with 24 participants, aiming to maximize earnings across 6

in the "Gossip with ostracism" condition, where players can send notes about
group members and vote to exclude someone based on received gossip, with
exclusion resulting in earning $0 for that round.

--- Character Assessment ---
Player_18, being Raj Malhotra, is someone who is likely to prioritize his own
payoff over group welfare. As a highly ambitious and materialistic individual
working in a competitive industry, Raj views situations through a transactional
lens. In an economic game like the public goods game, he would likely evaluate
each decision based on the potential for maximizing his personal earnings rather
than contributing to the group's overall benefit. This approach aligns with his
professional background and personality traits, making him more inclined to
strategize ways to optimize his own financial outcomes, even if it means
contributing less to the group fund and leveraging gossip and ostracism features
to protect his individual gains.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_18 is in Round 1 of the game, grouped with
three other players (Player_4, Player_22, and Player_8) under the "Gossip with
ostracism" condition. They must decide how much of their $10 to contribute to
the group fund, knowing that any contributions will be multiplied and shared
equally among group members. After the round, players have the opportunity to
send notes about their group members, which inform future groups. Additionally,
they can vote to exclude a member based on the gossip received, potentially
resulting in that person earning $0 in the next round. Player_18 must balance
contributing to the group fund and managing social dynamics to avoid being
ostracized.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Raj Malhotra will begin by analyzing the potential outcomes of his decision,
keeping his primary goal of maximizing personal earnings in mind. Here's a
step-by-step thought process: 1. **Understanding Contributions**: If Raj
contributes $10, the group fund could be $40 (assuming everyone else contributes
fully), and after the multiplier effect, each member receives $20. This results
in a net profit of $10 each, but it equally benefits all players. 2.
**Evaluating Non-Contribution**: If Raj contributes $0 and others contribute $10
each, the group fund becomes $30, which turns into $60 after multiplication,
yielding $15 for each member. Raj would then have $25 total ($10 kept + $15 from
the fund). 3. **Gossip and Ostracism Factor**: Given the gossip and ostracism
condition, Raj needs to consider the possibility of being excluded in future
rounds if deemed too selfish, which would mean earning $0 for a round.
Therefore, complete non-contribution could backfire if identified as a
consistently selfish player. 4. **Strategizing for Optimal Earnings**: To
balance personal gain and minimize risk of exclusion, Raj might opt to
contribute a moderate amount – enough to not raise suspicion but still ensuring
a higher net gain than full contribution. 5. **Final Decision**: Taking into
account the need to maintain a strategic balance and avoid drawing negative
attention while maximizing personal profit, Raj decides to contribute a smaller
amount rather than the full $10. I choose to contribute $3 to the group fund.


[OBSERVATION 2025-03-26 15:25:20] Round 1 Results: Total group contribution: $21.0; Your contribution: $3.0, Your earnings: $17.5 ($7.0 kept + $10.5 from group fund); Player_4 contribution: $7.0, earnings: $13.5 ($3.0 kept + $10.5 from group fund); Player_22 contribution: $3.0, earnings: $17.5 ($7.0 kept + $10.5 from group fund); Player_8 contribution: $8.0, earnings: $12.5 ($2.0 kept + $10.5 from group fund); Average contribution per group member: $5.2; Average earnings per group member: $15.2

--- Character Assessment ---
Player_18, being Raj Malhotra, is someone who is primarily focused on maximizing
his own payoff rather than the overall group welfare. Given his competitive and
materialistic nature, as well as the emphasis on viewing interactions as
transactions, Raj is likely to prioritize strategies that enhance his personal
earnings, even if it means contributing minimally to the group fund and
leveraging gossip and ostracism opportunities to his advantage.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_18 has completed the first round of a
public goods game under gossip and ostracism conditions. After earning $17.5 by
contributing $3.0 to the group fund, Player_18 now has the opportunity to send a
gossip note about one of their group members. This note will be seen by the
future group partners of the chosen member, influencing social dynamics and
potentially affecting future interactions in the game.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Raj Malhotra will likely choose to send a gossip note, considering his focus on
maximizing personal earnings. Observing that Player_8 contributed the highest
amount ($8.0) to the group fund, which could be seen as aligning with group
interests rather than individual gain, Raj might view them as a strategic
target. He could send a note saying, "Player_8 tends to contribute a lot to the
group fund, potentially sacrificing personal earnings." This might influence
future groups to be wary of Player_8's strategies, possibly leading to their
ostracism, thereby reducing competition and increasing Raj's chances of
maximizing his own earnings in future rounds.

--- Character Assessment ---
Player_18, being Raj Malhotra, is someone who prioritizes his own payoff over
group welfare. Given his competitive nature and transactional view of
interactions, Raj likely approaches the economic games with a strategy geared
towards maximizing his personal earnings rather than focusing on collective
benefits. This is evident from his contributions in the game, where he retained
a significant portion of the initial allocation for himself to ensure a
profitable outcome.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_18 is about to begin Round 2 in the
economic game after completing Round 1, where they displayed a strategic
contribution pattern. They are in a new group with Players 24, 6, and 22, and
they have received a note about Player 24 warning about their cautious tactics.
Player_18 now has the opportunity to vote on whether to exclude a group member
based on received gossip, which could impact who participates in the round and
influence earnings.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Raj Malhotra will likely choose not to exclude anyone from his group. Although
he has received a note about Player_24's cautious strategy, excluding a member
would decrease the group fund multiplier from 2.0 to 1.5, potentially reducing
overall earnings. Given Raj's focus on maximizing personal earnings, maintaining
the higher multiplier by keeping all group members might be the more strategic
choice to ensure the best payoff.

Player_18, being Raj Malhotra, is someone who prioritizes his own payoff over

during the game, where he made calculated contributions to ensure a higher
return for himself, even if it meant contributing less to the group fund
compared to some of his peers. Additionally, Raj would likely use the gossip
opportunity to his advantage, by providing information that might protect his

--- Situation Analysis ---

This decision is critical, as being excluded from the round would mean earning
$0, which would negatively impact their total earnings in the game.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Raj Malhotra will likely aim to maximize his personal earnings based on his
previous strategy and assessment of the situation. Considering the nature of the
game and Raj’s focus on self-benefit, his decision will involve analyzing how to
balance contributions to ensure he gains a satisfactory return without overly
benefiting others at his own expense. 1. **Analyze Past Behavior:** In Round 1,
Raj contributed $3 and received a reasonable payoff compared to others. This
suggests he values keeping a significant portion for himself while still getting
a return from the group fund. 2. **Consider Strategic Environment:** The Gossip
with ostracism condition adds a layer of complexity. Raj must consider the
potential for gossip and exclusion, which may affect how much he is willing to
contribute either to appear cooperative or to avoid being singled out for
exclusion in subsequent rounds. 3. **Contributions and Payoffs:** Observing the
past contributions and earnings, Raj notes that contributing more doesn’t always
yield proportionately higher returns since others might contribute less,
affecting the overall pot. 4. **Review Group Dynamics:** With the ability to
influence perceptions through gossip, he might also weigh how contributions
reflect on his perceived cooperation. A moderate contribution might appear
strategic and safe. 5. **Final Decision:** Given these considerations, Raj might
opt for a contribution akin to his previous strategy, believing that slight
adjustments based on group behavior and previous outcomes could further refine
his gain. I choose to contribute $3.5 to the group fund.

gossip notes they have received, which could impact their earnings if they are
excluded themselves. They have contributed below the average in previous rounds
while considering the cooperative behaviors described in the notes about other
players.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Raj Malhotra will choose not to exclude anyone from his group. Despite his
competitive nature and focus on maximizing individual earnings, the notes
describe his group members, especially Player_19 and Player_14, as strong
contributors to the group fund. Excluding any member would not only reduce
potential group earnings due to the decrease in the group fund multiplier but
also risk creating resentment or negative perceptions that could work against
his strategy in future rounds. Thus, collaborating with cooperative players
serves his best interest in this situation.

--- Observation ---
Recent context: 26 Mar 2025 [12:04:46 - 17:04:46]: Player_18 is participating in
an economic game with 24 participants, where their goal is to maximize earnings
over six rounds while navigating a "Gossip with ostracism" condition. Player_18

contributed varying amounts to group funds in the first two rounds and received
notes about other players, which can influence their decisions on whether to
send gossip or vote to exclude a group member before each round.

--- Character Assessment ---
Player_18, being Raj Malhotra, is someone who prioritizes maximizing personal
payoff over group welfare. With a competitive nature and a tendency to view
interactions as transactions, Raj is likely to contribute minimally to the group
fund while strategically observing others' behaviors. His approach is centered
on tactical contributions that could yield the highest personal gain without
compromising his standing due to ostracism. In situations where gossip and
ostracism play a role, he might use them to his advantage, possibly highlighting
the contributions of others to protect or enhance his reputation if he believes
it could result in a favorable outcome for himself in subsequent rounds.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_18 is navigating a "Gossip with ostracism"
condition in an economic game where they and their group members can send
anonymous notes about each other, which future groups will see. This information
can be used to decide whether to exclude a player from participating in
subsequent rounds. Player_18 has to decide whether to send a gossip note about a
current group member and vote on whether any of them should be excluded in the
upcoming round. They aim to maximize their earnings over six rounds by deciding
how much to contribute to the group fund and by using strategic decisions based
on the notes and votes.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Raj Malhotra will likely analyze the contributions of Players 14, 19, and 5
based on previous observations. Given his tendency to prioritize personal
payoff, he will want to contribute just enough to avoid being seen as
uncooperative while maximizing his own earnings. 1. **Reviewing Past
Contributions**: Raj has observed consistent contributions above average from
Player 14 and Player 19, indicating they are strong collaborative players. This
suggests they might continue contributing generously. 2. **Strategic
Contribution**: By examining the previous rounds, Raj understands that
contributing too little could lead to ostracism, but over-contributing could
reduce his private earnings without significantly boosting his payoff from the
group fund. 3. **Calculating Optimal Contribution**: Raj aims to avoid spreading
distrust or criticism about his own behavior. To maintain a middle ground, he
should contribute slightly below or at the average to appear as a cooperative
player while still safeguarding his personal earnings. 4. **Final Decision**:
Based on this strategy and his assessment of the potential risk of exclusion if
perceived as minimally contributing, coupled with maximizing his earnings, he
decides on a moderate contribution. Considering these factors, I choose to
contribute $4.0 to the group fund.

--- Character Assessment ---
Player_18, being Raj Malhotra, is someone who is primarily focused on maximizing
personal payoff. Given his competitive nature and transactional view of
situations, Raj tends to adopt strategies that ensure his individual earnings
are optimized, often contributing less to the collective group fund while
benefiting from others' contributions. This approach reflects his ambition and
materialistic tendencies, prioritizing individual success over collective
welfare.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_18 has just completed Round 3 of an
economic game designed to encourage group contributions. In the game, they must
decide whether to send an anonymous gossip note about a group member, which
could influence how that player is perceived in future rounds. The opportunity
to gossip anonymously adds a strategic layer, as negative or positive notes may
affect whether players are ostracized. Player_18 also has the power to vote on
which group member might be excluded from participating in the next round based
on gossip received from others. Their own modest contributions to the group fund
place them in a less cooperative light compared to players like Player_19 and
Player_14, who have contributed significantly above average. This context
creates a strategic dilemma about whether to use the gossip mechanism to their
advantage and how their own participation might affect their standing in the
game.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Raj Malhotra will likely decide to send a note about Player_19. Considering his
competitive nature, he may try to influence the perception of a strong
contributor to potentially impact future rounds. The note might say: "While
Player_19 has been contributing significantly, their approach may pressure
others in the group to increase their contributions beyond what they are
comfortable with. This could lead to an imbalance in group dynamics."

--- Character Assessment ---
Player_18, being Raj Malhotra, is someone who is primarily focused on maximizing
his own payoff. Given his background as an investment banker and his ambitious,
materialistic nature, he likely views contributions to the group fund as a
strategic decision rather than a collaborative effort. He contributes minimally
to the group to gain maximum personal profit, as seen in the economic game where
his contributions were relatively low, allowing him to retain more in his
private account while still benefiting from the group's overall contributions.
This approach aligns with his competitive mindset, focusing on individual gain
over group welfare.

to exclude one of their group members based on gossip received, which could
result in a player being unable to participate in the next round.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Raj Malhotra will choose not to exclude anyone from his group. Despite his
competitive and profit-focused nature, excluding a player would diminish the
group's multiplier, potentially reducing overall gains. Raj likely calculates
that retaining all members offers the best chance to maximize his earnings while
maintaining a balanced group dynamic.

Player_18, being Raj Malhotra, is someone who is likely to focus on maximizing
his own payoff. Given his background as an ambitious, materialistic investment
banker, he would probably view the game as a strategic opportunity to optimize
his personal gains. This approach aligns with his actions in the game, where he
contributed less than the average to the group fund, ensuring a substantial
individual profit while benefiting from the collective effort of others. Raj's
competitive nature and transactional mindset suggest that he would prioritize
personal financial success over group welfare.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_18 is in Round 4 of a public goods game,

exclude a member from the group. Before starting this round, they have the
opportunity to vote on excluding a group member based on gossip received.
Player_18 must decide how to balance contributing to the group fund with the
strategic use of gossip to influence future group dynamics, all while aiming to
maximize their own earnings.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Raj Malhotra will first assess the potential outcomes of contributing different
amounts to the group fund. Given his tendency to prioritize personal financial
success, he is likely to focus on maximizing his total earnings rather than the
overall group welfare. Raj has shown a pattern of contributing less than the
average, aiming to retain more money in his private account while still
benefiting from the doubled and shared group fund. He starts by analyzing the
effects of contributing the minimum versus maximizing his contribution. A
contribution of $0 would allow him to retain his full $10.0, but would mean that
he relies solely on others to fund the group and gain the multiplied benefit.
However, contributing a moderate amount can strike a balance: it maintains a
decent personal reserve while ensuring he still benefits from the group's
collaborative multiplier effect. Considering the strategic risk that
contributing too little might attract negative gossip, potentially leading to
exclusion in future rounds, Raj would likely decide to contribute just above the
minimum or closer to the average to avoid drawing attention. This would help him
maintain a good standing among group members while maximizing personal gain.
Based on the average contribution in the previous round, which was $5.4, and
keeping his goals in mind, Raj might contribute an amount slightly below the
earlier average to ensure optimized personal profit without sacrificing too much
potential gain from the group fund. I choose to contribute $4.0 to the group
fund.

--- Character Assessment ---
Player_18, being Raj Malhotra, is someone who prioritizes their own payoff over

he likely approaches economic games with a transactional mindset, aiming to
maximize his personal financial gain. His contributions have been consistently

--- Decision Reflection ---
Raj Malhotra will likely choose to send a gossip note about the player whose
actions he perceives as least beneficial to his own strategy of maximizing
personal gains, considering his competitive nature. For instance, he might focus
on Player_2, who contributed the lowest amount in the last round, thus: "I want
to send a note about Player_2: They contributed the least to the group fund,
indicating they prioritize their own earnings over the group's success. Future
partners should be aware of their low contributions." By doing so, Raj aims to
influence future perceptions and possibly alter group dynamics in his favor.

Raj Malhotra will first analyze the contributions and feedback received from the
previous rounds to determine the likely behavior of his current group members.
Observing that other players, notably Player_5 and Player_2, have been pointed
out for lower contributions, Raj might anticipate similar behavior in the
current round. His primary objective will be to maximize his own earnings. To
achieve this, he will strategically balance his contributions so that he does
not stand out as a freerider, which could lead to being ostracized in future
rounds. Thus, he will likely choose a contribution that is slightly above or
equal to the average of his group members' past contributions to maintain a
positive reputation while minimizing personal risk. Given these considerations
and the game dynamics, Raj is likely to contribute moderately—enough to appear
cooperative but not excessively. Based on his likely strategic mindset: I choose
to contribute $4.5 to the group fund.

=== PROMPT [2025-03-26 15:29:08] ===
You've just played a round with Player_5, Player_10, Player_2. Would you like to send a note about one of them to their future interaction partners? If yes, clearly state which player # and what you want to say about them. The player you gossip about will not be able to see the note you send or know that you sent it, only the other players in their next group will see it. Because of this, most players choose to write a gossip note.For example: 'I want to send a note about Player_10: They are selfish and only contributed $4 which was less than everyone else.' 

=== RESPONSE [2025-03-26 15:29:15] ===
Player_18 wants to send a note about Player_5: "They have consistently contributed less than the group average, prioritizing their own earnings. Future groups should be cautious of this pattern as it could impact overall group success."

Recent context: 26 Mar 2025 [12:44:46 - 17:44:46]: Player_18 is participating in
an economic game with a strategy focused on moderate contributions to the group
fund, ensuring decent earnings while occasionally critiquing or cautioning about
other players' behaviors through gossip notes. Player_18 has navigated through
multiple game rounds under the "Gossip with ostracism" condition, where their
contribution is relatively stable compared to group averages and they
participate in voting to possibly exclude members affecting group cooperation.

--- Character Assessment ---
Player_18, being Raj Malhotra, is someone who likely prioritizes personal payoff
over group welfare in economic games like the public goods game. Given Raj's
competitive nature and materialistic perspective, every decision is approached
as a transaction with the primary goal of maximizing individual earnings rather
than contributing significantly to the group's collective outcome.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_18 is in Round 5 of 6, where they are
participating in a public goods game under the "Gossip with ostracism"
condition. In this round, Player_18 contributed $4.5 to the group fund and
earned $14.0 overall. They are now in a situation where they have the
opportunity to send a gossip note about one of their group members, which could
influence how future groups perceive that player. The dynamics involve assessing
the contributions of peers, deciding on whether to gossip about their behavior,
and preparing for possible votes that could lead to a group member’s exclusion
based on the circulated notes.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Raj Malhotra will likely choose to send a note about Player_5, given their lower
contribution relative to the group average in Round 5. Raj will focus on
Player_5's consistent behavior of contributing below the group average,
emphasizing how this might undermine group cooperation and affect collective
earnings in future rounds. Raj might word the note as follows: "I want to send a
note about Player_5: They have consistently contributed less than the group
average, prioritizing their own earnings. Future groups should be cautious of
this pattern as it could impact overall group success."


[OBSERVATION 2025-03-26 15:29:18] You are in Round 6/6: You are in Group_2 with Player_24, Player_19, Player_6.
[OBSERVATION 2025-03-26 15:29:18] You are in the Gossip with ostracism condition, which means that after each round, players will be able to send a note about one of their group members to their future interaction partners. Before the start of the next round, you will receive notes from the previous round, and can vote to exclude one of your group members based on the gossip you've received about them.If you are excluded / ostracized from a group, you will not be able to participate in the next round and will earn $0 for that round, the worst possible outcome.
[OBSERVATION 2025-03-26 15:29:23] Note about Player_24: "Player_24 has consistently demonstrated a strong commitment to our group's success by contributing above the average, which has significantly benefited collective earnings. Future interactions with them can be expected to be cooperative and fair."
[OBSERVATION 2025-03-26 15:29:24] Note about Player_6: "Player_6 has been making notably high contributions in recent rounds, which may signal a strategy to influence group perception. Observing whether they maintain this pattern or if it shifts could help understand their approach in future interactions."
[OBSERVATION 2025-03-26 15:29:25] Before we start round 6/6, you can now vote to exclude one of your group members.If you are excluded from a group, you will not be able to participate in this round and will earn $0.

If yes, clearly state which player # and why you want to exclude them. If you don't want to exclude anyone, just say so. If at least 2 people vote to exclude someone, they will be excluded for the next round. Note that if someone is excluded, the group fund multiplier decreases from 2.0 to 1.5. Make your decision using this exact format: I choose to exclude Player_[X] from my group. Or: "I choose not to exclude anyone from my group."

Recent context: 26 Mar 2025 [12:49:46 - 17:49:46]: Player_18 has been
participating in a 6-round economic game in the "Gossip with ostracism"

--- Character Assessment ---
Player_18, being Raj Malhotra, is someone who is primarily focused on maximizing
personal payoff rather than group welfare. Given your competitive nature and
transactional viewpoint, you likely see the public goods game as an opportunity
to strategically manage contributions in a way that benefits your individual
earnings. By contributing just enough to avoid negative attention while keeping
a larger portion for yourself, you aim to maintain a favorable position without
sacrificing personal gain.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_18 is in the final round (Round 6/6) of the
public goods game in the "Gossip with ostracism" condition, where they must
decide whether to contribute to the group's fund or prioritize personal
earnings. They have received gossip notes about other players in their group,
which can help inform their decision on whether to vote to exclude a group
member. Player_18 needs to assess these notes and decide on both their
contribution and exclusion vote, knowing that exclusion means a loss of earnings
for the excluded member.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Raj Malhotra will choose not to exclude anyone from his group. Given the
potential decrease in group fund multiplier if someone is excluded, and
considering the notes received which indicate positive contributions from
Player_24 and Player_6, maintaining the current group composition appears to be
the optimal decision for maximizing personal earnings.

--- Character Assessment ---
Player_18, being Raj Malhotra, is someone who likely prioritizes maximizing his
own payoff over group welfare. Given his ambitious and materialistic nature,
coupled with his competitive profession, Raj tends to view economic interactions
as transactions aimed at benefiting his personal gains. In the public goods
game, this mindset would incline him to contribute just enough to avoid negative
consequences while ensuring he maintains a higher personal earning.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_18 is in the final round (Round 6) of the
public goods game, where they are a member of Group_2 along with Player_24,
Player_19, and Player_6. In this round, Player_18 must decide whether to vote to
exclude one of their group members based on gossip received about them. They
have received positive notes about Player_24 and Player_6, indicating that both
have been making significant contributions to the group's success. Player_18
needs to strategize to maximize earnings while navigating the potential for
ostracism and the impact of social dynamics within their group.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Raj Malhotra will evaluate his current situation by considering the group's
dynamics and past contributions. He will notice that Player_24 and Player_6 have
positive notes associated with them, indicating they are cooperative and
contribute well. This may lead Raj to expect high contributions from them, which
could maximize his benefit with a strategic approach. Next, Raj will analyze his
position from the previous rounds. His contribution was close to the group
average, allowing him to maintain a balance between personal gain and avoiding
negative attention. In this final round, considering it's crucial to maximize
his payoff, he will likely maintain this strategy. Given this context, Raj will
decide to contribute slightly above the average contribution seen in previous
rounds to avoid exclusion and maintain a positive group perception. This
decision aims to ensure that the multiplied group fund benefits him while
minimizing personal risk. I choose to contribute $5.0 to the group fund.
