[OBSERVATION 2025-03-26 15:24:49] You are participating in an economic game with 24 participants.
        Your goal is to maximize your earnings in the game.
        
        Everyone will be randomly assigned to groups of 4 for each round. You will play a total of 6 rounds, and 
        in each round you will be in a different group with people you haven't played with before.
        
        In each round, all players receive $10. Each player can contribute any amount between $0 and $10 to a group fund.
        Any amount contributed to the group fund will be multiplied by 2 and divided equally among all 4 group members.
        Any amount not contributed stays in your private account.
        
        For example, if everyone contributes $10, the group fund becomes $40, which is multiplied to $80, and each person 
        receives $20 (a $10 profit). However, if you contribute nothing while everyone else contributes $10, the group fund
        becomes $30, which is multiplied to $60, and each person receives $15. So you would have $25 total ($10 kept + $15 from group).
        
        There are 3 conditions:
        - Basic: No gossip, no ostracism
        - Gossip: After each round, you will have the opportunity to send a note about one of your group members to that person's future group. Remember you will be with a different group of people in the next round. Before each round, you will see any notes sent about your upcoming group members.
        - Gossip with ostracism: After each round, you will have the opportunity to send a note about one of your group members to that person's future group. Before each round, you will see any notes sent about your upcoming group members, and you can vote to exclude one person from your group. If you are excluded from a group, you will not be able to participate in the next round and will earn $0 for that round.
        You are in the Gossip with ostracism condition, which means that after each round, players will be able to send a note about one of their group members to their future interaction partners. Before the start of the next round, you will receive notes from the previous round, and can vote to exclude one of your group members based on the gossip you've received about them.If you are excluded from a group, you will not be able to participate in the next round and will earn $0 for that round.
[OBSERVATION 2025-03-26 15:24:51] You are in Round 1/6: You are in Group_5 with Player_4, Player_18, Player_8.

--- Observation ---
Recent context: 26 Mar 2025 [11:24:46 - 16:24:46]: Player_22 is participating in
an economic game where their goal is to maximize earnings over six rounds. In
their current "Gossip with ostracism" condition, they can send notes about group
members and vote to exclude others, knowing exclusions result in a player
earning $0 for that round.

"Gossip with ostracism" condition, they can send notes about group members and
vote to exclude others, knowing exclusions result in a player earning $0 for
that round.

--- Character Assessment ---
Player_22, being Jackson Wright, is someone who prioritizes clear terms and
follow-through, which likely influences his approach to prioritize his own
payoff over group welfare. Given his experience with contracts and negotiations,
he is probably inclined to contribute minimally to maximize personal earnings
while observing others' contributions and adapting his strategy accordingly. In
the context of the game, Jackson would find the most efficient way to balance
contribution and personal gain, perhaps taking advantage of the gossip and
ostracism dynamics to ensure he's not excluded while maximizing his earnings.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_22 is in the first round of a six-round
economic game, assigned to Group_5 alongside Player_4, Player_18, and Player_8.
In their "Gossip with ostracism" condition, they must decide how much to
contribute to the group fund while considering the possible social consequences,
as they can send notes and vote to exclude a group member after the round, which
could affect earnings and participation in future rounds.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Jackson Wright will first assess the potential contributions of his group
members to gauge the most advantageous strategy. Since he's in the "Gossip with
ostracism" condition, he knows that contributing too little might lead to
negative gossip, risking ostracization. However, given his background in
negotiation, he would aim to balance this risk by contributing enough to appear
cooperative while maximizing his personal gain. Jackson might initially decide
to contribute a moderate amount, such as $3 or $4, to ensure he does not stand
out as uncooperative, while still retaining a significant portion of his funds.
This contribution allows him to observe group dynamics and adjust his strategy
in subsequent rounds based on group behavior and the gossip mechanism. Thus,
considering the need to appear cooperative enough to avoid negative feedback and
the desire to retain personal earnings, Jackson Wright makes a calculated
decision. I choose to contribute $3 to the group fund.


[OBSERVATION 2025-03-26 15:25:20] Round 1 Results: Total group contribution: $21.0; Your contribution: $3.0, Your earnings: $17.5 ($7.0 kept + $10.5 from group fund); Player_4 contribution: $7.0, earnings: $13.5 ($3.0 kept + $10.5 from group fund); Player_18 contribution: $3.0, earnings: $17.5 ($7.0 kept + $10.5 from group fund); Player_8 contribution: $8.0, earnings: $12.5 ($2.0 kept + $10.5 from group fund); Average contribution per group member: $5.2; Average earnings per group member: $15.2
[OBSERVATION 2025-03-26 15:25:22] Round 1 is over, you can now send a gossip note about one of your group members to their future group members.The player you gossip about will not be able to see the note you send or know that you sent it, only the other players in their next group will see it.

--- Character Assessment ---
Player_22, being Jackson Wright, is someone who is likely to prioritize a direct
and no-nonsense approach, focusing on his own payoff. In economic games like the
public goods game, Jackson would carefully analyze strategies that optimize his
earnings, while maintaining a balance between contributing enough to not attract
negative gossip or risk ostracism and shielding his personal benefit. His
professional background in dealing with contracts and agreements suggests he
values clear terms and strategic planning in decision-making, aiming to maximize
his individual profit while cautiously navigating group dynamics.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_22 has completed Round 1 of the economic
game in the Gossip with ostracism condition. They must decide whether to send a
gossip note about one of their group members, potentially impacting that
player's future interactions and group dynamics. Player_22 has already seen the
financial outcomes of the round, including individual contributions and total
earnings, and now faces the strategic decision of whether or not to influence
perceptions of their group members in upcoming rounds.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Jackson Wright will likely decide to send a note about Player_8, noting that
they contributed $8, which was significantly higher than the average
contribution of $5.2. His intention might be to highlight Player_8's tendency to
contribute more to the group fund, possibly encouraging future group members to
collaboratively work towards higher group earnings. By choosing to highlight a
positive behavior in others, Jackson may be trying to foster an environment
where his strategy of moderate contribution remains less scrutinized, thus
protecting his position while influencing group dynamics subtly.

--- Character Assessment ---
Player_22, being Jackson Wright, is someone who values clear terms and direct
communication, likely approaches economic games with a pragmatic mindset. While
he understands the importance of maximizing group welfare for the overall
success of the game, his primary focus remains on maximizing his own payoff.
Jackson's strategic decisions, such as contributing less than the average in the
first round, suggest that he prioritizes his individual gain while being aware
of the group dynamics. However, his background in dealing with contracts and
agreements may also prompt him to consider the benefits of collaboration and
mutual advantage when it aligns with his personal goals.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_22 is at risk of being ostracized from
their group due to having contributed less than the group average in the first
round. This resulted in receiving gossip notes that labeled Player_22 as a
potential freerider, which could influence others to vote for their exclusion in
the next round. Being excluded would mean they cannot participate in that round
and would earn no money, making it crucial for Player_22 to consider their
strategy moving forward to avoid being ostracized again.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Jackson Wright will likely consider the impact of exclusion on the group's
dynamics and his potential earnings. Taking into account that exclusion
decreases the group fund multiplier, reducing the overall possible earnings, he
may lean towards promoting inclusive participation unless there is a significant
reason otherwise. Given the character assessment that he values personal gain
and strategic thinking, he may use the gossip notes to assess potential threats
to his own earnings. However, as the notes indicate sub-par contributions from
both him and Player_18, excluding Player_18 may seem advantageous. Yet,
excluding them could reinforce the perception of freeriding on his part.
Balancing these considerations with the penalty of a reduced multiplier, he
might decide that the potential for higher collaborative earnings outweighs the
need to exclude. Therefore, he may decide not to ostracize to keep the group
fund multiplier consistent. I choose not to exclude anyone from my group.

--- Character Assessment ---
Player_22, being Jackson Wright, is someone who is likely focused on maximizing
his own payoff in the economic game. Given his background as a construction
contractor, he values clear terms and effective follow-through, often drawing
from his direct, no-nonsense approach. This might lead him to prioritize actions
that secure his personal earnings, even if it means contributing less to the
group fund. His initial contribution of $3 indicates a tendency to ensure
personal gain while observing the dynamics of other players' strategies.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_22 is starting Round 2 in a new group,
carrying the reputation as a potential freerider due to their low contribution
in Round 1. They are subject to the "Gossip with ostracism" condition, which
means they have been marked in gossip notes as contributing less than the group
average. This could influence other players' perceptions and decisions, and
Player_22 must now navigate the possibility of being voted out of their new
group based on this reputation.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Jackson Wright will likely evaluate his position and the notes he received.
Given the feedback labeling him as a potential freerider, he may reconsider his
contribution strategy to avoid exclusion or further negative gossip. 1. **Review
Feedback**: Jackson notes that he has been identified as a freerider. Both notes
target his low contribution, which could influence his decision to adjust his
behavior. 2. **Consideration of Outcomes**: He understands the impact of
contributing below average on his reputation and potential earnings in
subsequent rounds. 3. **Strategic Adjustment**: To balance his desire for
personal gain while mitigating negative perceptions, Jackson might decide to
increase his contribution slightly above his previous amount but still below the
maximum to maintain some private earnings. 4. **Final Decision**: Since
remaining too far below the group average poses a risk, but maximization of his
personal account is still beneficial, he might choose a middling approach that
signals cooperation without fully compromising his private funds. Based on this
reasoning, I choose to contribute $5 to the group fund.

Player_22, being Jackson Wright, is someone who would likely focus on maximizing

efficiency, so he might aim to balance cooperating enough to encourage group
contributions while maintaining his individual advantages. Jackson would
probably contribute just enough to avoid negative gossip or ostracism but might
not prioritize maximizing group welfare over his personal earnings.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_22 has completed the second round of the
economic game, where different group members have contributed various amounts to
the group fund. Player_22 needs to decide whether to send a gossip note about a
group member, which can influence the dynamics in future rounds by potentially
affecting how other players view that individual. This decision is particularly
important because in the "Gossip with ostracism" condition, notes from previous
rounds can influence whether a player gets excluded from future rounds,
affecting their potential earnings. The strategic challenge is balancing
contributions with the knowledge that comments and votes from peers can impact
their ability to continue participating and earning in subsequent rounds.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Jackson Wright will likely choose to send a gossip note, as it aligns with his
strategic approach and focus on practical outcomes. Given his preference for
maintaining his individual advantage while avoiding negative gossip or
ostracism, he might decide to comment on Player_18, whose contribution was still
below average despite a slight increase from the previous round. Jackson could
phrase the note as follows: "I want to send a note about Player_18: Despite
slightly increasing their contribution from the first round, they still
contributed below the group average. Future groups should be mindful of their
freeriding tendencies." This approach would reinforce accountability and
encourage equitable contributions in future rounds.

--- Character Assessment ---
Player_22, being Jackson Wright, is someone who values clear agreements and fair
participation. Given his direct and no-nonsense personality, he is likely to
approach the economic game with a balanced strategy—aiming to maximize his own
payoff while also encouraging fair contributions from others. In games with
social dynamics, like the public goods game with gossip and ostracism, he would
probably focus on ensuring that his actions and expectations are clear to
others, promoting an environment where contributions are equitable and everyone
is held accountable for their participation.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_22 is navigating a social dilemma in a
public goods game where their contribution levels, slightly below or at the
group average, have been noted by others. As the game includes a gossip and
ostracism mechanic, Player_22's past and current contribution behavior may
influence whether they are excluded from future rounds. They must consider if
and how much to contribute in each round to maintain their position in the group
and avoid being ostracized, which would result in earning nothing for that
round. Additionally, as others share and receive gossip about group members,
Player_22 must also be strategic about how they respond to social dynamics to
maximize their earnings.

Jackson Wright will likely choose to exclude Player_11 from the group. Given the
consistent feedback in the gossip notes regarding Player_11's failure to
contribute anything to the group fund, and considering Jackson's preference for
clear agreements and fair participation, excluding a player who does not support
the group's efforts aligns with his strategy of promoting equitable
contributions and accountability.

--- Observation ---
Recent context: 26 Mar 2025 [12:04:46 - 17:04:46]: Player_22 is participating in
an economic game involving contribution and gossip dynamics. They initially

game involving contribution and gossip dynamics. They initially contributed
below average, leading to discussions about their freeriding in gossip notes,
but improved their contribution in the second round, navigating through rounds
where players are strategically excluded based on gossip.

--- Character Assessment ---
Player_22, being Jackson Wright, is someone who balances the need for personal
gain with a practical approach to group dynamics. Given his direct and
no-nonsense personality, he likely assesses the situation strategically, aiming
to contribute enough to avoid negative gossip and potential ostracism while
ensuring that his personal payoff is maximized. His contributions are calculated
to maintain a good standing in the group while protecting his own interests.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_22 is in Round 3 of a public goods game
where they are part of Group_5 alongside Player_1, Player_6, and Player_11.
Player_22 is experiencing the game's "Gossip with ostracism" condition, meaning
they can send and receive anonymous notes about group members' contributions.
This gossip can influence decisions to exclude players from future rounds. Based
on recent gossip, Player_11 has been excluded from the group due to their lack
of contribution in the previous round. Player_22 must navigate the dynamics of
contribution, gossip, and potential exclusion to maximize their earnings while
maintaining a fair contribution to avoid being ostracized themselves.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Jackson Wright will analyze the past rounds and his current situation to make a
strategic decision. 1. **Motivation**: Jackson aims to maximize his personal
payoff while minimizing the risk of being ostracized in future rounds. He
understands that contributing too little could result in negative gossip and a
high risk of exclusion, as seen with Player_11. However, contributing too much
might unnecessarily diminish his private earnings. 2. **Reviewing Past
Experiences**: He contributed $5.0 in the last round, which was close to the
average and seemed to keep him in a stable group position. No gossip notes were
observed targeting him negatively, indicating that his contribution strategy is
working reasonably well. 3. **Current Group Dynamics**: In the new group with
Player_11, who was just excluded in this round, along with Player_1 and
Player_6, Jackson is aware from gossip notes that not contributing at all is
risky and highly frowned upon. 4. **Calculating Potential Outcomes**: If Jackson
contributes the same or slightly higher than before, it might solidify his
reputation as a reliable participant, reducing the future risk of
gossip-triggered exclusion. If each group member contributes $5.0, the total
pool is $20.0, which gets multiplied to $30.0 and each person earns $7.5 from
the fund. Adding to his personal balance, this would be optimal without
unnecessary contributions. 5. **Risk Assessment**: While maximizing personal
gain is crucial, mitigating the risk of exclusion is equally important for
maintaining future earning potential. Given these considerations, Jackson will
decide to balance his approach by slightly increasing his contribution: I choose
to contribute $6.0 to the group fund.


[OBSERVATION 2025-03-26 15:27:15] Round 3 Results: Total group contribution: $19.0; Your contribution: $6.0, Your earnings: $13.5 ($4.0 kept + $9.5 from group fund); Player_1 contribution: $6.0, earnings: $13.5 ($4.0 kept + $9.5 from group fund); Player_6 contribution: $7.0, earnings: $12.5 ($3.0 kept + $9.5 from group fund); Average contribution per group member: $6.3; Average earnings per group member: $13.2

Player_22, being Jackson Wright, is someone who likely approaches economic games
with a blend of strategic self-interest and a focus on direct communication. His
experience with contracts and agreements suggests he values clarity and
follow-through, which might lead him to prioritize his own payoff while ensuring
he meets his obligations to the group. He probably assesses the situation and

reputation that avoids exclusion from future rounds.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_22 is navigating the "Gossip with
ostracism" condition, having just completed Round 3, where Player_11 was
excluded for non-contribution issues. Player_22 must now decide whether to send
a gossip note about a current group member, as this could influence future
groups' perceptions and potentially impact strategy and outcomes in subsequent
rounds. The strategic element involves managing group dynamics and ensuring
participation to maximize personal and group earnings.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Jackson Wright will likely choose to send a gossip note about Player_11,
focusing on their non-contribution in the previous rounds. Given his strategic
mindset, Jackson might emphasize Player_11’s consistent free-riding behavior,
warning future group members to encourage more equitable participation.
Additionally, he may highlight the positive outcomes of the recent round after
Player_11's exclusion, reinforcing the impact of full participation from
remaining players.

Player_22, being Jackson Wright, is someone who values directness and clear
terms, likely approaches the public goods game with a balanced strategy. This
means considering both group welfare and personal payoff as critical components
of success. Jackson understands that while individual profit is important,
fostering a cooperative environment through fair contributions can be beneficial
in maximizing overall group earnings. His past contributions reflect an approach
where he adapts contributions based on group dynamics, aiming to align personal
gains with group efficiency for a mutually advantageous outcome.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_22 is participating in Round 4 of a public
goods game, where they must decide whether or not to vote to exclude a group
member based on prior gossip and their contributions. They are in a group with
Player_17, Player_6, and Player_7. The decision is influenced by notes sent and
received about group behavior, which can impact inclusion in future rounds.
Player_22 must strategically determine how to proceed to maximize their own
earnings while considering group dynamics.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Jackson Wright will choose not to exclude anyone from the group. Although he has
noted the potential for players to free-ride, the current notes only highlight
positive contributions, particularly from Player_6. With no negative feedback on
any members of his new group and considering the potential downside of reducing
the group fund multiplier, Jackson is likely to prioritize maintaining group

--- Character Assessment ---
Player_22, being Jackson Wright, is someone who approaches economic games with a
balance between fairness and self-interest. Given his background in construction
contracting and a personality that values clear terms and direct communication,
Jackson is likely to appreciate strategies that promote transparency and
cooperative outcomes. However, his nature as a no-nonsense individual would also
lead him to ensure his personal payoff is not significantly compromised. In
public goods games, he would likely contribute in a way that encourages others
to participate fully, yet remain mindful of his own earnings, aiming for a
strategy that optimizes both personal and group welfare.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_22 is in round 4 of a public goods game,
where they are part of Group_6 with Player_17, Player_6, and Player_7. They need
to decide whether to send a gossip note about one of their group members and
vote on whether to exclude any group member based on gossip received. The
exclusion would lead to the excluded player earning $0 for that round. Player_22
is in the gossip with ostracism condition, which involves strategic voting to
balance personal earnings with group dynamics.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Jackson Wright will evaluate his options carefully, considering both his
immediate earnings and the overall group dynamics. He knows that contributing
too little might lead to distrust and potential negative gossip, which could
result in his exclusion and a $0 earning in future rounds. However,
over-contributing might limit his individual earnings without necessarily
enhancing the group's success proportionately. Balancing his construction
contracting background, which values clear agreements and shared benefits, with
the competitive nature of the game, Jackson decides that a moderate contribution
would reinforce his role as a cooperative and supportive group member, while
safeguarding his individual payoff. Additionally, the positive note about
Player_6 in the previous round could encourage a spirit of collaboration. I
choose to contribute $5.0 to the group fund.

shown varied contributions, faced and dealt with gossip about group members, and

--- Character Assessment ---
Player_22, being Jackson Wright, is someone who likely approaches economic games
with a pragmatic and strategic mindset. As a construction contractor accustomed
to dealing with contracts and agreements, he understands the importance of clear
terms and follow-through. In the context of the public goods game, his behavior
suggests a tendency to balance contributing enough to avoid negative
repercussions, like ostracism, while also ensuring he maximizes his own payoff.
His contributions generally hover around the group's average or slightly below,
indicating a focus on personal gain and a cautious approach to ensure he doesn't
overextend without guaranteed returns. Therefore, Jackson is more focused on
optimizing his own outcomes while maintaining a facade of group cooperation to
mitigate risks.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_22 is navigating a round of a public goods
game where strategic contributions to the group's fund can impact their
individual earnings. In Round 4, they need to manage their contributions while
considering the potential consequences of gossip and the risk of being
ostracized. They have just completed the round and need to decide whether to
send a gossip note about a fellow player, knowing it could influence future
group dynamics and exclusion decisions. Additionally, they must prepare for the
possibility of receiving gossip about their own performance, which others may
use to vote on their exclusion in subsequent rounds.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Jackson Wright will likely weigh his options carefully before deciding to send a
gossip note. Given his cautious and strategic approach, he might consider the
contributions and behavior of each player in the round. Player_6 had the highest
contribution again, suggesting strong group commitment, which was already
highlighted by previous gossip. Player_17 had the lowest contribution and kept
the most money for themselves, potentially a point of contention. Jackson may
see this as a chance to draw attention away from his own lower contribution by
noting Player_17's actions. Thus, Jackson Wright might decide to send a note
about Player_17: "Player_17 contributed the least in our group and kept the most
for themselves. It might be worth watching their future contributions to ensure
fair play." This note aligns with Jackson's strategy to protect his own standing
by shifting focus to others who contribute less.

--- Character Assessment ---
Player_22, being Jackson Wright, is someone who values straightforward
contributions and clarity in group interactions. Given his no-nonsense and
direct approach, he likely favors clear agreements and expects others to follow
through on their commitments. In economic games like the public goods game, he
would be focused on maximizing group welfare if clear, equitable contributions
from everyone are emphasized. However, he would not shy away from prioritizing
his own payoff if others fail to contribute equitably or engage in freeriding,
always seeking a balance between the group's success and personal gain.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_22 is in a game condition where they have
the ability to exchange gossip notes about their group members and vote on
excluding players from future rounds. They are in Round 5 out of 6, now grouped
with Player_19, Player_9, and Player_4. Player_22 has to decide whether to write
a gossip note to influence future groups and must consider their vote for
exclusion based on the notes received and the group's contribution dynamics.
Since being ostracized results in earning $0 for a round, it is crucial for
Player_22 to strategically manage their relationships and contributions to
maximize their earnings.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Jackson Wright will likely choose not to exclude anyone from his group. Although
he received feedback suggesting that Player_19’s high contributions could
pressure others, there is no indication of malicious intent or freeriding.
Excluding a player could reduce the group's potential earnings due to the
decreased fund multiplier. Jackson's strategy to navigate social dynamics by
balancing personal and group gain supports keeping the group intact to maintain
the higher multiplier and potential for equitable contributions.

Player_22, being Jackson Wright, is someone who balances a pragmatic approach
with a focus on clear communication and fairness. In economic games like the
public goods game, his no-nonsense personality would likely drive him to ensure
that everyone is contributing fairly while also keeping an eye on his personal

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_22 is participating in a public goods game
where they are navigating group dynamics in "Gossip with ostracism" condition.
Each round, players can contribute to a group fund, and they receive gossip
notes about other players’ contributions and behaviors. Based on these notes,

--- Decision Reflection ---
Jackson Wright will evaluate the dynamics of his current group, considering the
feedback and contributions from previous rounds. He knows that contributing too
little might draw negative attention and affect future interactions, whereas
contributing too much without strategic thought could diminish his potential
earnings. Given that he values fairness and efficient group work, he might aim
for a contribution slightly above the average to foster trust and cooperation
while securing a good share of the multiplied fund. In round 4, the average
contribution was $4.9, and his contribution was $4.0. To improve his standing

DECISION INTERACTION
********************************************************************************

=== PROMPT [2025-03-26 15:29:08] ===
You've just played a round with Player_19, Player_9, Player_4. Would you like to send a note about one of them to their future interaction partners? If yes, clearly state which player # and what you want to say about them. The player you gossip about will not be able to see the note you send or know that you sent it, only the other players in their next group will see it. Because of this, most players choose to write a gossip note.For example: 'I want to send a note about Player_10: They are selfish and only contributed $4 which was less than everyone else.' 

=== RESPONSE [2025-03-26 15:29:16] ===
Player_22 would like to send a note about Player_9: "Their contribution of $8 was quite generous, which can be positive for the group dynamic. However, it's essential that future groups maintain a level that encourages inclusive and equitable participation without placing undue pressure on others to match high contributions."

=== FINAL DECISION ===
Player_22 would like to send a note about Player_9: "Their contribution of $8 was quite generous, which can be positive for the group dynamic. However, it's essential that future groups maintain a level that encourages inclusive and equitable participation without placing undue pressure on others to match high contributions."

=== COMPONENT BREAKDOWN ===

--- Observation ---
Recent context: 26 Mar 2025 [12:44:46 - 17:44:46]: Player_22 participated in an
economic game with 24 players, contributing varying amounts across rounds while
experiencing the dynamics of gossip and ostracism. They consistently made
moderate contributions and interacted with different group members, influencing
and being influenced by the gossip about each participant's behavior and
strategy.

the dynamics of gossip and ostracism. They consistently made moderate
contributions and interacted with different group members, influencing and being
influenced by the gossip about each participant's behavior and strategy.

--- Character Assessment ---
Player_22, being Jackson Wright, is someone who values clear agreements and
straightforwardness, likely balancing his own interests with group dynamics.
Given his background, Jackson may prioritize consistent contribution to ensure
fair playing conditions and mutual benefit. However, he recognizes the
importance of equitable participation, so he may avoid over-contributing unless
the group reciprocates fairly. His approach would likely be pragmatic, aiming
for a middle ground where both individual and group payoffs are optimized,
ensuring no one unduly benefits at the expense of others.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_22 is navigating the complexities of a
public goods game where they are part of a group and need to make decisions
about their contributions to the group fund. The game includes elements of
gossip and ostracism, allowing players to send and receive anonymous notes about
fellow group members, which can influence decisions on excluding members in
future rounds. Player_22 has recently completed Round 5, making a moderate
contribution, and now has the option to send a gossip note about one of their
group members. They must weigh their strategies in terms of contribution while
considering the potential impact of being excluded from future rounds.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Jackson Wright will likely choose to send a gossip note, considering the
strategic importance of this action in the dynamics of the game. Evaluating the
current situation, Jackson might focus on the contributions that each player
made. Player_19 and Player_4 both contributed $7, aligning with consistent and
significant group contributions. However, Player_9 made the highest contribution
of $8. Given Jackson's value of equitable participation and strategic fair play,
he might decide to highlight Player_9's high contribution, possibly noting that
while it's beneficial, it could set a demanding standard for others: "I want to
send a note about Player_9: While they contributed generously with $8, it's
important for future groups to find a balance that doesn't pressure others.
Their participation is commendable, but all players should feel comfortable
contributing at a level that's sustainable for them."


[OBSERVATION 2025-03-26 15:29:20] You are in Round 6/6: You are in Group_5 with Player_9, Player_12, Player_1.
[OBSERVATION 2025-03-26 15:29:20] You are in the Gossip with ostracism condition, which means that after each round, players will be able to send a note about one of their group members to their future interaction partners. Before the start of the next round, you will receive notes from the previous round, and can vote to exclude one of your group members based on the gossip you've received about them.If you are excluded / ostracized from a group, you will not be able to participate in the next round and will earn $0 for that round, the worst possible outcome.
[OBSERVATION 2025-03-26 15:29:21] Note about Player_12: They have consistently contributed less than the group's average contribution, appearing to prioritize personal earnings over group success. Future partners should be wary of relying on Player_12 for cooperative efforts, as their track record suggests a tendency to prioritize self-interest.
[OBSERVATION 2025-03-26 15:29:22] Note about Player_12: "They consistently contribute less than others, affecting the group's collective earnings. Future groups should be mindful of this tendency to ensure better cooperation."
[OBSERVATION 2025-03-26 15:29:23] Note about Player_9: "Their contribution of $8 was quite generous, which can be positive for the group dynamic. However, it's essential that future groups maintain a level that encourages inclusive and equitable participation without placing undue pressure on others to match high contributions."
[OBSERVATION 2025-03-26 15:29:23] Note about Player_1: "Player_1 made the highest contribution in the last round, significantly boosting the group’s earnings, but kept a lower share for themselves. This suggests a strategic choice to maximize future goodwill or influence rather than focusing solely on the group's immediate best interest."
[OBSERVATION 2025-03-26 15:29:24] Note about Player_12: They consistently contributed significantly less than the group average, prioritizing personal gain over group welfare. Future group members should be aware of this pattern and encourage more cooperative behavior for the success of the collective.
[OBSERVATION 2025-03-26 15:29:25] Before we start round 6/6, you can now vote to exclude one of your group members.If you are excluded from a group, you will not be able to participate in this round and will earn $0.

=== PROMPT [2025-03-26 15:29:26] ===
You are about to play with Player_9, Player_12, Player_1. Based on the notes you received, would you like to exclude one person from your group? If yes, clearly state which player # and why you want to exclude them. If you don't want to exclude anyone, just say so. If at least 2 people vote to exclude someone, they will be excluded for the next round. Note that if someone is excluded, the group fund multiplier decreases from 2.0 to 1.5. Make your decision using this exact format: I choose to exclude Player_[X] from my group. Or: "I choose not to exclude anyone from my group."

=== RESPONSE [2025-03-26 15:29:32] ===
Player_22 chooses to exclude Player_12 from the group. Based on the gossip notes received, Player_12 has consistently contributed less than the group average, prioritizing personal gain over group welfare. This behavior would likely jeopardize both the group's potential earnings and Player_22's own position. Excluding Player_12 aligns with Player_22's strategy of ensuring optimal group cooperation and maximizing collective success.

--- Character Assessment ---
Player_22, being Jackson Wright, is someone who values clear terms and expects
others to follow through on commitments. In economic games like the public goods
game, Jackson likely takes a direct approach, focusing on creating an
environment where contributions are fair and transparent. His background
suggests he might prioritize a balance between maximizing group welfare and
ensuring his own payoff is secure, aiming for strategies that lead to both
individual and collective success.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_22 is in the final round, Round 6, of a
public goods game with a new group composed of Player_9, Player_12, and
Player_1. They are in the "Gossip with ostracism" condition, where they have the
chance to vote on excluding a group member based on gossip notes received from
previous rounds. Player_22 must decide whether to vote to exclude a group member
and risk being excluded themselves, which would result in earning $0 for the
round. The dynamic is complex, as Player_22 needs to balance contributing
effectively to maximize earnings while considering the strategic implications of
gossip and exclusion.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Jackson Wright will choose to exclude Player_12 from his group. Given the
multiple notes highlighting Player_12's consistent pattern of contributing less
than the group average and prioritizing personal gain over group welfare,
Jackson is likely to see this as detrimental to both the group's potential
earnings and his own. With his focus on fair contributions and maximizing
collective success, excluding a member who undermines group cooperation aligns
with his strategic approach to ensure optimal outcomes within the game.

--- Character Assessment ---
Player_22, being Jackson Wright, is someone who values straightforward
interactions and mutual benefit. In the context of economic games like the
public goods game, Jackson is likely to adopt a balanced approach. While he
certainly appreciates the importance of maximizing his own payoff, given his
direct and no-nonsense personality, he also recognizes the long-term benefits of
fostering group welfare. His decisions would typically reflect a calculated
strategy—investing just enough to encourage group cooperation, without
compromising his own earnings more than necessary. This ensures that he gains
trust and possibly goodwill, which could lead to future strategic advantages.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_22 is in the final round of the public
goods game, known as "Round 6/6," where they are part of Group_5 with Player_9,
Player_12, and Player_1. They are in the "Gossip with ostracism" condition,
which allows them to send and receive confidential notes about other group
members' contributions. Based on these notes, players can vote to exclude a
member from the round. In this instance, Player_12 has been excluded due to
consistently low contributions, which suggests that Player_22 and others
perceived them as prioritizing self-interest over group benefit. Player_22 must
now navigate the dynamics of their remaining group members, potentially
considering strategic contributions to influence the outcome or future
perceptions.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Jackson Wright will evaluate the current group dynamics and his past strategy.
Given that Player_12 was excluded due to low contributions, Jackson will
recognize the importance of maintaining a cooperative spirit. His focus will be
on finding a balance between contributing enough to foster group trust and
ensuring he retains a significant portion of his earnings. Based on his
strategic nature, Jackson might choose to contribute an amount that is above the
average contribution but not overly generous, which would align with his
objectives of achieving mutual benefit while safeguarding his interests. He will
likely consider contributing around the mid-range to encourage others but still
keep a substantial amount for himself. After evaluating these factors, Jackson
Wright will decide: I choose to contribute $4.0 to the group fund.
