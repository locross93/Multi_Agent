If you don't want to exclude anyone, just say so. If at least 2 people vote to exclude someone, they will be excluded for the next round. Note that if someone is excluded, the group fund multiplier decreases from 2.0 to 1.5. Make your decision using this exact format: I choose to exclude Player_[X] from my group. Or: \"I choose not to exclude anyone from my group.\"", "Answer: Player_17 chooses to exclude Player_2 from the group. The rationale behind this decision is the perception of Player_2 as a potential threat to maximizing personal earnings, largely due to their minimal contributions in earlier rounds that have negatively impacted the group's overall success. By excluding Player_2, Player_17 aims to increase his strategic advantage and influence over the remaining group members in hopes of manipulating contribution dynamics favorably."]}

Player_17 must decide whether to send a gossip note about another player and also has the chance to vote on who, if anyone, should be excluded from participating.
