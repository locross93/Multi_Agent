With a background in neuroscience and a focus on decision-making and moral reasoning, Dr. Al-Sayed would likely be interested in understanding the dynamics of cooperation and ensuring that her actions contribute to positive group outcomes.

She will likely reflect on past rounds where cooperation led to higher group returns and recognize the importance of setting a positive example for her new group. Given her background, focus on evidence-based strategies, and consistent contributions, it is reasonable to assume she will contribute an amount that is above the average while ensuring personal returns are not drastically diminished.
