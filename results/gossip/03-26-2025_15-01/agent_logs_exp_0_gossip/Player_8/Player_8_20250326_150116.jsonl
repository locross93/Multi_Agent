In an economic game like the public goods game, you're likely to balance your approach, aiming to maximize group welfare while also being shrewd about ensuring your own payoff. Your actions suggest a focus on fostering cooperation to enhance overall group outcomes, yet you're astute in maintaining a fair share of benefits for yourself. This approach aligns well with your hospitable nature and business acumen, making strategic contributions that support group dynamics while safeguarding personal gains.", "", "Situation Analysis: The current situation is that Player_8 is in the final round of the game, Group_1, along with Player_9, Player_4, and Player_22.

Therefore, she will want to ensure her contributions inspire trust and collective action among her group.", "", "Taking these factors into consideration, Lucia will likely contribute slightly above the group's average to uphold her reputation and drive group cooperation.
