Throughout the game, notes were shared about players' contribution habits to influence future group dynamics and optimize collaborative success.", "", "Character Assessment: Player_20, being Sarah Chen, is someone who values efficiency and fairness, reflecting a balanced approach in economic games like the public goods game. She is likely to focus on strategic decision-making that aims to maximize group welfare while also ensuring her own payoff is reasonable. Her analytical and cautious nature suggests that she carefully evaluates the contributions of others and adapts her strategy to align with what is best for both herself and the group's overall success.", "", "Situation Analysis: The current situation is that Player_20 is participating in the final round of a public goods game, where they have the opportunity to contribute to a group fund and then distribute their earnings based on group contributions. They are in Group_5 with players including Player_3, Player_12, and Player_8.

Given her tendency to prioritize a balance between personal gains and group welfare, she will consider the performance of Player_12 and Player_8, who have shown less cooperative behavior. ", "", "She recalls Player_12's consistent contributions around the group average, suggesting that Player_12 might not significantly disrupt the group's potential earnings. However, considering Player_8's history of contributing the least, Sarah might anticipate a lower group contribution and thus a reduced multiplication effect on the fund. ", "", "Sarah understands that maximizing her overall earnings involves both contributing enough to boost the group's total and keeping a sufficient amount in her private account. To strike a balance, she might decide to contribute slightly above the average of previous rounds, ensuring she supports the group's success while safeguarding her own interests.", "", "Contributing around or slightly above $8 would enhance the group's potential payout while maintaining her personal earnings.

How much money you will contribute to the group fund (any amount between $0 and $10.0)? The group fund will be multiplied by 2.0 and divided equally among all players.
