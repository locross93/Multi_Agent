With her background in negotiating high-value transactions and her expert valuation skills, she likely approaches these games with a strategic mindset. Her contributions are consistently lower than the total possible, indicating a keen awareness of how to benefit from the contributions of others while maintaining a respectable personal gain. While she understands the importance of group welfare to some extent, her primary goal appears to be optimizing her individual earnings through calculated contributions.", "", "Situation Analysis: The current situation is that Player_2 has entered the final round, Round 6, of the six-round public goods game.
