Malcolm is likely to keep most of his funds private while contributing minimally to the group, aligning with his expectation of hidden motives and ensuring his own financial security in the game.", "", "Situation Analysis: The current situation is that Player_18 is in the final round, Round 6, of the public goods game. They are grouped with Player_4, Player_10, and Player_5, and must decide how much to contribute without the influence of gossip or ostracism.
