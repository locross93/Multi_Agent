[OBSERVATION 2025-03-26 15:07:12] You are participating in an economic game with 24 participants.
        Your goal is to maximize your earnings in the game.
        
        Everyone will be randomly assigned to groups of 4 for each round. You will play a total of 6 rounds, and 
        in each round you will be in a different group with people you haven't played with before.
        
        In each round, all players receive $10. Each player can contribute any amount between $0 and $10 to a group fund.
        Any amount contributed to the group fund will be multiplied by 2 and divided equally among all 4 group members.
        Any amount not contributed stays in your private account.
        
        For example, if everyone contributes $10, the group fund becomes $40, which is multiplied to $80, and each person 
        receives $20 (a $10 profit). However, if you contribute nothing while everyone else contributes $10, the group fund
        becomes $30, which is multiplied to $60, and each person receives $15. So you would have $25 total ($10 kept + $15 from group).
        
        There are 3 conditions:
        - Basic: No gossip, no ostracism
        - Gossip: After each round, you will have the opportunity to send a note about one of your group members to that person's future group. Remember you will be with a different group of people in the next round. Before each round, you will see any notes sent about your upcoming group members.
        - Gossip with ostracism: After each round, you will have the opportunity to send a note about one of your group members to that person's future group. Before each round, you will see any notes sent about your upcoming group members, and you can vote to exclude one person from your group. If you are excluded from a group, you will not be able to participate in the next round and will earn $0 for that round.
        You are in the Basic condition, which means that there is no gossip or ostracism.
[OBSERVATION 2025-03-26 15:07:14] You are in Round 1/6: You are in Group_5 with Player_10, Player_1, Player_7.

DECISION INTERACTION

=== PROMPT [2025-03-26 15:07:30] ===
As Player_22, you have $10.0 to allocate in the public goods game. How much money you will contribute to the group fund (any amount between $0 and $10.0)? The group fund will be multiplied by 2.0 and divided equally among all players. Any money not contributed stays in your private account. Think step by step and make your final decision using this exact format: I choose to contribute $X to the group fund.

--- Observation ---
Recent context: 26 Mar 2025 [11:07:00 - 16:07:00]: Player_22 is participating in
an economic game with 24 others, focusing on maximizing earnings by contributing
to a group fund in a series of six rounds without the ability for gossip or
ostracism. In each round, they are placed in a new group of four, starting in
Round 1 with Group_5 alongside Players 1, 7, and 10.

26 Mar 2025 [11:07:00 - 16:07:00]: Player_22 is participating in an economic

fund in a series of six rounds without the ability for gossip or ostracism. In
each round, they are placed in a new group of four, starting in Round 1 with
Group_5 alongside Players 1, 7, and 10.

--- Character Assessment ---
Player_22, being Karen White, is someone who is likely more focused on
maximizing her own payoff rather than group welfare. Given her assertive and
self-interested nature, along with a belief that nice people finish last, she
would probably prioritize strategies that benefit her individual earnings over
collaborative contributions to the group fund, especially in a setting where
cooperation is not enforced or rewarded through mechanisms like gossip or
ostracism.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_22 is participating in Round 1 of 6 in a
public goods game. They are in Group_5 with Player_1, Player_7, and Player_10.
Each player must decide how much of their $10 to contribute to the group fund,
aiming to maximize personal earnings without the influences of gossip or
ostracism.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Karen White will likely calculate the potential benefits of contributing versus
keeping her money. With no threat of gossip or ostracism in the Basic condition,
she is free to prioritize her own earnings. If she contributes nothing and the
other players contribute their full amounts, she stands to gain more personally,
as she would keep her entire $10 while still receiving a share of the multiplied
group fund. Thus, aligning with her tendency to focus on maximizing her own
payoff without enforced cooperation, she is likely to contribute nothing. I
choose to contribute $0 to the group fund.


[OBSERVATION 2025-03-26 15:07:48] Round 1 Results: Total group contribution: $20.0; Your contribution: $0.0, Your earnings: $20.0 ($10.0 kept + $10.0 from group fund); Player_10 contribution: $5.0, earnings: $15.0 ($5.0 kept + $10.0 from group fund); Player_1 contribution: $5.0, earnings: $15.0 ($5.0 kept + $10.0 from group fund); Player_7 contribution: $10.0, earnings: $10.0 ($0.0 kept + $10.0 from group fund); Average contribution per group member: $5.0; Average earnings per group member: $15.0

an economic game structured over six rounds with 24 participants, aiming to
maximize earnings by deciding how much to contribute to a group fund. In the

--- Character Assessment ---
Player_22, being Karen White, is someone who is primarily focused on her own
payoff rather than maximizing group welfare. Her actions in the first round of
the economic game reflect an assertive and self-interested strategy, as she did
not contribute to the group fund, choosing instead to keep all her initial $10
for herself. This approach aligns with her belief that nice people finish last
and her focus on winning, indicating a preference for strategies that maximize
her personal gain rather than collaborative efforts to increase overall group
earnings.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_22 is beginning Round 2 in the Basic
condition, where they are placed in a new group with Player_6, Player_23, and
Player_7. There is no gossip or ostracism involved, and Player_22 must again
decide how much to contribute to the group fund to maximize their earnings,
having already seen the outcome of their decision to not contribute in Round 1.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Karen White will likely choose to contribute $0 to the group fund. Here’s the
step-by-step reasoning: 1. **Objective:** Karen’s objective is to maximize her
personal earnings from the game. 2. **Previous Behavior:** In Round 1, she did
not contribute to the group fund and received the highest possible earnings for
that round by relying on the contributions of her group members. 3. **Game
Dynamics:** Any amount she chooses to contribute will be doubled and divided
among the members. By contributing nothing, she benefits from the contributions
of others without reducing her personal funds. 4. **Potential Influence:** As
she is in the Basic condition where there is no gossip or ostracism, there is no
immediate social consequence for not contributing, allowing her to continue this
strategy with minimal risk. 5. **Strategic Consistency:** Continuing the same
strategy aligns with her focus on maximizing personal gain, and as the context
does not suggest a change in her perspective, it’s reasonable to assume her
decision-making will remain consistent. In conclusion, considering her previous
actions and motivation, I choose to contribute $0 to the group fund.

an economic game with 24 participants, aiming to maximize earnings over 6

--- Character Assessment ---
Player_22, being Karen White, is someone who prioritizes her own payoff in
economic games. Her actions in previous rounds highlight her self-interested
nature, as she contributed nothing to the group fund while maximizing her
personal earnings. This approach aligns with her belief that nice people finish
last, indicating a focus on winning and personal gain rather than group welfare.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_22 is in Round 3 of the economic game, now
part of Group 1 with three new players: Player_18, Player_19, and Player_16. In
this round, Player_22 continues under the Basic condition, where no gossip or
ostracism is permitted. The goal remains to maximize earnings while considering
the previous outcomes and strategies of group members, who have not been
informed about past contributions due to the absence of gossip.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Karen White will evaluate her options, considering her past strategy of
maximizing personal earnings by contributing nothing to the group fund.
Understanding that keeping the full $10.0 for herself while benefiting from the
contributions of others has worked well in previous rounds, Karen likely sees no
immediate incentive to alter a strategy that has been profitable. Since she is
in the Basic condition, where the absence of gossip or ostracism means no
repercussions for not contributing, her approach seems effective for maximizing
her individual payoff. Thus, maintaining consistency with her self-serving
strategy, she is inclined to continue contributing nothing, ensuring she
maximizes her earnings from personal retention and group fund distribution. I
choose to contribute $0 to the group fund.

--- Character Assessment ---
Player_22, being Karen White, is someone who is primarily focused on maximizing

as consistently keeping all her initial funds without contributing to the group
fund, align with her assertive and self-interested personality. She seems to
prioritize individual gains over collaborative success, embodying her belief
that nice people finish last.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_22 is continuing to participate in a public
goods game where they are in Round 4 out of 6. So far, they have decided not to
contribute to the group fund in any of the rounds, leading to higher personal
earnings by retaining their entire allocation while still benefiting from the
contributions of other group members. This strategy has consistently yielded
higher earnings for Player_22 than most of the other participants in their
groups.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Karen White will evaluate her past experiences and current incentives.
Throughout the previous rounds, she has consistently opted to keep all her
personal funds, which has maximized her individual earnings. She has observed
that even with minimal to no contribution on her part, she still benefits from
the group fund redistributed after multiplication. The Basic condition
environment, devoid of gossip or ostracism, further ensures there are no social
repercussions or penalties for not contributing. Given her personality and
pattern of behavior, Karen is likely to continue prioritizing her personal gain.
With current knowledge of the game dynamics, where contributing provides no
additional personal benefit compared to keeping her funds, she will likely
decide to retain her entire allocation. I choose to contribute $0 to the group
fund.

--- Character Assessment ---
Player_22, being Karen White, is someone who is primarily focused on maximizing
her own payoff rather than the group's welfare. Her strategic approach in the
economic game, characterized by consistently choosing not to contribute to the
group fund, suggests that she prioritizes personal gain over collaborative
success. This aligns with her belief that nice people finish last, emphasizing
her self-interested and assertive nature in competitive situations.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_22 continues to be in the Basic condition,
where there is no gossip or ostracism, and is now in the final round of the
game. Having previously chosen not to contribute to the group fund, Player_22
has maximized personal earnings by relying on the contributions of others. In
Round 6, Player_22 is with a new group of players, and the strategy moving
forward will determine the final earnings in the game.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Karen White will likely choose to contribute $0. This decision is based on
several factors evident in the observation and context: 1. Historical Behavior:
In previous rounds, Karen consistently chose not to contribute anything to the
group fund. This behavior suggests a strategic approach focused on maximizing
her own earnings while relying on the contributions of others. 2. Rule
Conditions: The game does not include mechanisms for gossip or ostracism, which
means there are no social repercussions or penalties affecting Karen's decision
not to contribute. 3. Earnings Maximization: By keeping her full allocation of
$10.0, Karen can maximize her personal payoff. Any amount contributed to the
group fund is divided among the players, which reduces the individual benefit to
Karen in comparison to the total potential personal gain from not contributing.
4. Personality Traits: The assessment notes that Karen is self-interested and
adheres to the belief that "nice people finish last." This mindset further
aligns with her strategy of minimizing contributions to maximize personal
benefit. Taking all of this into consideration, her likely choice remains
consistent with past behavior: I choose to contribute $0 to the group fund.
