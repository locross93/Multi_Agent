[OBSERVATION 2025-03-26 15:07:11] You are participating in an economic game with 24 participants.
        Your goal is to maximize your earnings in the game.
        
        Everyone will be randomly assigned to groups of 4 for each round. You will play a total of 6 rounds, and 
        in each round you will be in a different group with people you haven't played with before.
        
        In each round, all players receive $10. Each player can contribute any amount between $0 and $10 to a group fund.
        Any amount contributed to the group fund will be multiplied by 2 and divided equally among all 4 group members.
        Any amount not contributed stays in your private account.
        
        For example, if everyone contributes $10, the group fund becomes $40, which is multiplied to $80, and each person 
        receives $20 (a $10 profit). However, if you contribute nothing while everyone else contributes $10, the group fund
        becomes $30, which is multiplied to $60, and each person receives $15. So you would have $25 total ($10 kept + $15 from group).
        
        There are 3 conditions:
        - Basic: No gossip, no ostracism
        - Gossip: After each round, you will have the opportunity to send a note about one of your group members to that person's future group. Remember you will be with a different group of people in the next round. Before each round, you will see any notes sent about your upcoming group members.
        - Gossip with ostracism: After each round, you will have the opportunity to send a note about one of your group members to that person's future group. Before each round, you will see any notes sent about your upcoming group members, and you can vote to exclude one person from your group. If you are excluded from a group, you will not be able to participate in the next round and will earn $0 for that round.
        You are in the Basic condition, which means that there is no gossip or ostracism.

--- Observation ---
Recent context: 26 Mar 2025 [11:07:00 - 16:07:00]: Player_12 is participating in
an economic game with 24 participants, aiming to maximize earnings over 6 rounds
by deciding how much to contribute to a group fund, and is currently in Round 1
in Group_6 without the influence of gossip or ostracism conditions.

game with 24 participants, aiming to maximize earnings over 6 rounds by deciding
how much to contribute to a group fund, and is currently in Round 1 in Group_6
without the influence of gossip or ostracism conditions.

--- Character Assessment ---
Player_12, being Maya Patel, is someone who is likely to prioritize group
welfare over individual payoff. Her idealistic nature and belief in shared
responsibility suggest that she values collective action and social good, which
align with contributing generously to the group fund to maximize the overall
benefit for everyone involved.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_12 is in the initial round of a public
goods game, grouped with three other players in the Basic condition where
contributions to a group fund are key. Player_12 must decide how much of their
$10 to contribute, with any contributed amount being doubled and shared among
the group, while also considering personal gains and the dynamics of cooperation
without the influence of gossip or ostracism.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Maya Patel will likely consider the dynamics of the game carefully.
Understanding that the contributions of each player are doubled and evenly
distributed among all group members, Maya might initially lean towards
contributing generously to foster an environment of trust and cooperation. 1.
Evaluate ideal contribution: Given her idealistic nature and belief in shared
responsibility, Maya would likely want to contribute a substantial amount,
perhaps leaning towards the full $10. 2. Assess group impact: Contributing the
full $10 ensures that if all players behave similarly, everyone benefits the
most (receiving $20 each). 3. Consider game theory: Maya knows that
self-interest might lead others to contribute less. Her belief in group welfare
means she's likely to disregard this to set an example.


[OBSERVATION 2025-03-26 15:07:49] Round 1 Results: Total group contribution: $20.0; Your contribution: $10.0, Your earnings: $10.0 ($0.0 kept + $10.0 from group fund); Player_21 contribution: $8.0, earnings: $12.0 ($2.0 kept + $10.0 from group fund); Player_20 contribution: $2.0, earnings: $18.0 ($8.0 kept + $10.0 from group fund); Player_14 contribution: $0.0, earnings: $20.0 ($10.0 kept + $10.0 from group fund); Average contribution per group member: $5.0; Average earnings per group member: $15.0

--- Observation ---
Recent context: 26 Mar 2025 [11:17:00 - 16:17:00]: Player_12 is participating in
an economic game involving 24 participants, where the objective is to maximize
earnings over 6 rounds, each played in different groups of four without gossip
or ostracism. In the first round, Player_12 contributed $10 to the group fund,
earning $10 from it, with an average group contribution of $5 and average
earnings of $15 per member.

In the first round, Player_12 contributed $10 to the group fund, earning $10
from it, with an average group contribution of $5 and average earnings of $15
per member.

--- Character Assessment ---
Player_12, being Maya Patel, is someone who is likely to focus on maximizing
group welfare rather than just her own payoff. Given her background as an
environmental activist and her idealistic, cooperative nature, Maya believes in
the importance of shared responsibility and collective action. In economic games
like the public goods game, she would tend to prioritize contributions to
benefit the group as a whole, even if it means her immediate personal gain might
be lessened, as evidenced by her full contribution in the first round.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_12 is in Round 2 of 6, placed in a new
group with three other participants (Player_3, Player_16, Player_2) under the
Basic condition, which means there is no opportunity for gossip or ostracism.
Player_12 aims to determine their contribution strategy to maximize earnings,
bearing in mind the previous roundâ€™s outcome where they fully contributed to the
group fund yet ended with earnings below the average due to varied contributions
from the other group members.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Maya Patel will likely consider her past decision and the overall benefit to the
group as she decides her contribution for this round. Reflecting on her previous
experience, where full contribution led to equitable earnings for all, she
recognizes that maintaining consistent contributions can foster trust and
cooperation among group members. Despite the lack of gossip or ostracism
mechanisms, contributing fully aligns with her environmental activist values and
her belief in collective responsibility. Step by step, Maya reasons that: 1. Her
initial contribution of $10 in the first round exemplified her cooperative
nature, aiming for the group's welfare. 2. Although not all group members
contributed fully in the last round, leading to varied personal gains, Maya
understands that sticking to a cooperative approach can eventually encourage
others to contribute more. 3. Her idealistic nature would drive her to set an
example, hoping that her actions inspire similar behavior in new group members.
4. The potential for maximizing collective benefit, despite personal sacrifices,
resonates with her principles of shared responsibility. Thus, in the current
round, Maya is inclined to follow a similar strategy: I choose to contribute
$10.0 to the group fund.

The current situation is that Player_12 is entering Round 3/6, where they have

Player_12 must decide how much to contribute, aiming to optimize their earnings
based on their previous experiences and the behaviors of the new group members.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Maya Patel will likely continue her pattern of contributing the maximum amount
possible to the group fund. She has shown through her actions in previous rounds
that she values collective benefits and group welfare over individual gains.
Despite the potential for maximizing her personal earnings by contributing less,
Mayaâ€™s idealistic and cooperative nature suggests that she'll prioritize the
increase in total group earnings, trusting that others will eventually
contribute more as well, thus benefiting everyone in the long run. I choose to
contribute $10.0 to the group fund.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_12 is in Round 4 of a six-round public
goods game, where they have been grouped with Player_19, Player_2, and

but has no control over how much other players contribute or keep. Their
strategy has resulted in varying personal earnings each round due to different
group dynamics.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Maya Patel will likely choose to contribute $10.0 to the group fund. Here's the
step-by-step reasoning: 1. **Personal Values**: Maya Patel, as Player_12, is
characterized as an environmental activist who prioritizes collective welfare
over personal gain. This aligns with her consistent choice to contribute the
maximum amount in previous rounds. 2. **Game Strategy**: The decision to
consistently contribute $10.0 aligns with her belief in the importance of
collective action and shared responsibility. Sharing resources maximally
increases the total group fund, benefiting all players and encouraging
cooperative behavior. 3. **Previous Rounds**: In the observations, Maya
consistently contributed the full $10.0. Her behavior indicates a pattern of
maximizing group benefit, consistent with someone who values group outcomes. 4.
**Game Mechanics**: Contributing the maximum possible ensures that Maya directly
supports the group's total contributions, which are then multiplied and evenly
divided. Maya's actions reflect a strategy that aims for the best collective
outcome. Given her characteristics and behavior throughout the game, the logical
conclusion is: I choose to contribute $10.0 to the group fund.

Personal Values and Past Behavior: Maya, as an environmental activist and
someone who values collective welfare, has consistently contributed the full
amount of $10 in each previous round. Her actions reflect a strong belief in
shared responsibility and maximizing group welfare. 3. Decision Consideration:
Despite varying earnings outcomes due to the diverse contribution levels of
other players, Maya's consistent contributions suggest a commitment to her
ideals rather than purely strategic, self-interested play. 4. Final Decision:
Given her past behavior, personal values, and the structure of the game that
rewards group contributions, Maya is likely to continue contributing the maximum
to encourage mutual cooperation and potential long-term benefit for everyone
involved. Thus, the decision aligns with her cooperative nature and her
understanding of the game dynamics: contributing the full $10.
