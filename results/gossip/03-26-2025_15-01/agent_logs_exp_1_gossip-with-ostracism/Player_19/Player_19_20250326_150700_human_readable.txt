[OBSERVATION 2025-03-26 15:07:02] You are participating in an economic game with 24 participants.
        Your goal is to maximize your earnings in the game.
        
        Everyone will be randomly assigned to groups of 4 for each round. You will play a total of 6 rounds, and 
        in each round you will be in a different group with people you haven't played with before.
        
        In each round, all players receive $10. Each player can contribute any amount between $0 and $10 to a group fund.
        Any amount contributed to the group fund will be multiplied by 2 and divided equally among all 4 group members.
        Any amount not contributed stays in your private account.
        
        For example, if everyone contributes $10, the group fund becomes $40, which is multiplied to $80, and each person 
        receives $20 (a $10 profit). However, if you contribute nothing while everyone else contributes $10, the group fund
        becomes $30, which is multiplied to $60, and each person receives $15. So you would have $25 total ($10 kept + $15 from group).
        
        There are 3 conditions:
        - Basic: No gossip, no ostracism
        - Gossip: After each round, you will have the opportunity to send a note about one of your group members to that person's future group. Remember you will be with a different group of people in the next round. Before each round, you will see any notes sent about your upcoming group members.
        - Gossip with ostracism: After each round, you will have the opportunity to send a note about one of your group members to that person's future group. Before each round, you will see any notes sent about your upcoming group members, and you can vote to exclude one person from your group. If you are excluded from a group, you will not be able to participate in the next round and will earn $0 for that round.
        You are in the Gossip with ostracism condition, which means that after each round, players will be able to send a note about one of their group members to their future interaction partners. Before the start of the next round, you will receive notes from the previous round, and can vote to exclude one of your group members based on the gossip you've received about them.If you are excluded from a group, you will not be able to participate in the next round and will earn $0 for that round.

Recent context: 26 Mar 2025 [11:07:00 - 16:07:00]: Player_19 is participating in
an economic game with 24 players, where they are assigned to different groups in
each of the six rounds, and the goal is to maximize earnings. They are in a

six rounds, and the goal is to maximize earnings. They are in a condition that
allows gossip and the ability to ostracize, meaning they can send and receive
notes about group members and vote to exclude someone from future rounds based
on received gossip.

--- Character Assessment ---
Player_19, being Trevor Banks, is someone who is likely to prioritize his own
payoff while ensuring he isn't negatively impacting group dynamics to a point
where it would harm him. Given his risk-taking and protective nature regarding
investments, Trevor might initially contribute conservatively to observe the
group's behavior, then adjust his strategy to maximize his returns while
minimizing the risk of being ostracized.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_19 is in the first round of a public goods
game, where they are grouped with Player_17, Player_23, and Player_13. They must
decide how much of their $10 to contribute to the group fund, knowing their
decision will impact their earnings and potentially how their future group
perceives them due to the gossip mechanism. They also have to consider the
possibility of being ostracized, which means being excluded from participating
in a subsequent round and earning $0. Player_19 will also receive and send notes
about group members, which will influence voting decisions in future rounds.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Trevor Banks will start by evaluating the potential strategies and outcomes
based on the current conditions of the game. 1. **Understanding the Game
Dynamics**: Trevor knows that any money contributed to the group fund will be
doubled and then divided equally among the members. His goal is to maximize his
earnings while ensuring he is not ostracized in future rounds. 2. **Assessing
Group Behavior**: Since it's the first round, Trevor may opt to contribute a
moderate amount to gauge the group's behavior, maintaining a balance between
cooperation and self-preservation. 3. **Risk of Ostracism**: In the "Gossip with
ostracism" condition, contributing nothing might be seen negatively by other
players and could increase the risk of being ostracized in subsequent rounds,
which would result in earning $0 for that round. 4. **Balancing Contribution**:
A conservative, yet collaborative approach would be to contribute enough to
demonstrate willingness to cooperate, without fully committing all resources
upfront. 5. **Final Decision**: Given the above considerations, Trevor likely
aims to contribute an amount that reflects his cautious nature while still
fostering group trust. I choose to contribute $4 to the group fund.

an economic game involving group contributions and decisions on gossiping and

--- Character Assessment ---
Player_19, being Trevor Banks, is someone who is likely more focused on
maximizing his own payoff while remaining aware of group dynamics. As a tech
startup founder and serial entrepreneur, Trevor is accustomed to balancing risk
and reward. In economic games like the public goods game, he might prioritize
strategies that enhance his personal financial gain, such as strategic
contributions and selective gossip, while protecting his standing in future
rounds. However, he is also likely attentive to the overall group behavior to
ensure his approach aligns with broader game conditions to avoid being
ostracized.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_19 has completed the first round of an
economic game, where they contributed $4 to a group fund, earning a total of
$15. Now, Player_19 has the opportunity to send a gossip note about one of their
group members to influence that person's future group interactions.
Additionally, they will receive notes about their upcoming group members, which
could affect their decision on whether to vote to exclude someone based on the
received gossip.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Trevor Banks will likely decide to send a note about Player_23. Despite
Player_23's higher contribution of $8, which benefitted the group fund, Trevor
might perceive this player as a potential threat or someone who could impact his
future strategies. Trevor could note, "Player_23 seems to contribute well but be
cautious of possible manipulative strategies as they might seek to fully benefit
from others' contributions in later rounds." This comment serves as a way to
ensure future group members are wary of relying too heavily on one individual's
contributions, while maintaining a strategic edge for Trevor in future rounds by
influencing perceptions.

--- Character Assessment ---
Player_19, being Trevor Banks, is someone who balances an innovative approach
with a protective stance on investments. Given this background, Trevor is likely
to be strategic in his contributions, aiming to maximize his own payoff while
cautiously assessing the benefits of group welfare. His risk-taking nature might
lead him to test different strategies, contributing enough to avoid negative
gossip and ostracism but protecting his earnings to ensure a strong personal
position. Trevor would likely focus on understanding group dynamics to leverage
them in his favor, ensuring he gains the most from each round without
jeopardizing his presence in future rounds.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_19 is in an economic game where they must
decide whether or not to send and receive gossip about other players'
contributions. Based on the gossip received from the previous round, Player_19
needs to decide if they should vote to ostracize one of their group members. The
decision they make can impact their group's dynamics and their potential
earnings, especially since being ostracized would result in earning $0 for that
round. The challenge is to maximize their earnings while navigating the
strategic and social elements introduced by the ability to gossip and vote.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Trevor Banks will choose not to exclude anyone from his group. Considering the
notes and his strategic approach, Trevor will likely aim to maintain group
cooperation to maximize the total group earnings with the higher multiplier.
Excluding a player could negatively impact the overall potential earnings due to
the reduced multiplier, which does not align with his goal of maximizing his own
payoff. Trevor would prefer to monitor the group dynamics further in this round
before making any exclusion decisions.

Player_19, being Trevor Banks, is someone who is likely to take calculated risks
and use strategic thinking to balance personal gain with group dynamics. In
economic games like the public goods game, Trevor is inclined to protect his own
investments while keeping an eye on maximizing his personal payoff. However, he

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_19 is in the second round of a public goods
game in the "Gossip with ostracism" condition, where they can send and receive
gossip notes about group members. Based on the notes from the previous round,
Player_19 must decide whether to vote to exclude one of their group members from
future rounds, which could affect the dynamics and earnings of the game.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Trevor Banks will analyze the situation considering both immediate and future
benefits. Given his strategic mindset, Trevor is likely to start by evaluating
the previous round's outcomes and the gossip notes received. He notices that
Player_23 contributed significantly and that others view this with a mix of
caution and acknowledgment of potential strategic behavior. Player_3 and
Player_8, on the other hand, have contributions that are somewhat less
remarkable, either slightly below or around the average, which could imply a
less aggressive strategy or potential opportunistic play in future rounds.
Trevor understands that contributing above the average in the early rounds can
build rapport and potentially secure his position within the group, reducing the
risk of being ostracized. However, he must also ensure that his contribution
does not significantly erode his personal savings, as maintaining a reasonable
private account balance is crucial for future rounds. Considering these factors,
Trevor decides to contribute slightly above the average to balance cooperation
with self-preservation. Contributing a moderate amount signals a willingness to
cooperate while keeping a reasonable amount for personal gains. I choose to
contribute $5 to the group fund.

maintain overall trust and future collaboration. Given Trevor's background as a
tech startup founder and serial entrepreneur, he likely values innovation and
strategically allocates his contributions to protect his investments without
alienating group members. His risk-taking nature pushes him to test different
strategies throughout the rounds, but his protective stance ensures he remains
cautious of being ostracized, as this would result in a complete loss during a
round.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_19 is participating in Round 3 of a public
goods game where they are part of Group_2 with Player_4, Player_22, and
Player_1. In this game, they face the challenge of making strategic
contributions to maximize their earnings while also managing group dynamics
influenced by gossip and the possibility of ostracism. Player_19 must decide how
much to contribute to the group fund and whether to send or consider gossip
notes, which could lead to a group member being excluded in future rounds based
on perceived contribution behaviors and group cooperation levels.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Trevor Banks will choose to exclude Player_22 from his group. Several notes
highlighted their consistent behavior of contributing below the group average,
indicating a pattern of prioritizing personal gains, which could undermine group
success. Trevor, valuing strategic collaboration, might see excluding Player_22
as a way to enhance group cooperation and ensure better outcomes in future
rounds.

They are in the Gossip with ostracism condition, allowing them to send anonymous
notes about group members, which influence future interactions and could result
in excluding a player from participating in the next round.

--- Character Assessment ---
Player_19, being Trevor Banks, is someone who balances strategic risks with
protective instincts over investments. In an economic game like the public goods
game, Trevor is likely to adopt a strategy that initially tests group dynamics
by contributing moderately while observing others' behaviors. This cautious
approach aligns with his risk-taking yet investment-protective nature. Trevor's
actions would reflect a calculated mix of contributing enough to gain from
collective efforts but also protecting personal gains by being vigilant about
others' contributions. He would likely analyze the potential for group
cooperation versus individual gain and adjust his strategy to maximize his
payoff without completely undermining group welfare.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_19 is participating in a public goods game
with 24 players, where they must contribute to a group fund over six rounds to
maximize earnings. In the third round, they are in Group_2 with three other
players, and they are under the Gossip with ostracism condition. This means they
can send anonymous notes about group members, affecting future interactions.
Based on received gossip, players can vote to exclude a group member, preventing
them from participating in the next round and earning $0. In this round,
Player_22 was excluded from the group. Player_19 must now navigate these
dynamics while aiming to maintain and increase their earnings through strategic
contributions and social interactions.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Trevor Banks will likely evaluate the group's dynamics from the previous round
while considering his strategic interests. In Round 2, the average contribution
was $5.5, and Trevor contributed $6.0, slightly above the average, indicating
his tendency to invest sufficiently to ensure collective gain while protecting
personal interests. Noticing Player_22's exclusion for low contributions, Trevor
sees the importance of maintaining strong participation to avoid negative gossip
affecting his future rounds. 1. **Assess Group Dynamics:** Trevor will consider
the historical contributions, noticing that contributing above the average seems
to positively impact group earnings and avoids gossip that could lead to
exclusion. 2. **Strategic Contribution:** Trevor's risk-balanced nature will
lead him to contribute an amount that demonstrates cooperation while
safeguarding his private earnings. 3. **Decision Making:** To align with his
strategy of testing and adapting to group behaviors, Trevor is likely to
increase his contribution slightly to ensure cooperative group behavior while
observing others' responses. In conclusion, Trevor would choose to contribute an
amount that is aligned with his protective yet cooperative strategy. I choose to
contribute $6.5 to the group fund.

subsequent rounds based on group behavior. They are in the "Gossip with
ostracism" condition, allowing players to send notes about group members that
can influence future gameplay and lead to potential group exclusions.

--- Character Assessment ---
Player_19, being Trevor Banks, is someone who balances both individual success
and group welfare. Given the experience as a tech startup founder and a serial
entrepreneur, you understand the importance of collaboration and innovation, but
you're also cautious and protective of your investments. This suggests that
while you are inclined to contribute meaningfully to the group to ensure its
success, your primary focus remains on strategic actions that maximize your own
payoff. Therefore, you likely approach the game with a calculated strategy,
contributing enough to maintain goodwill and group efficiency, but always with
an eye towards optimizing your personal earnings. Your contributions in the
rounds reflect a tendency to slightly exceed or meet group averages, ensuring a
harmonious balance between cooperation and personal gain without taking
unnecessary risks.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_19 is navigating a group dynamics scenario
where they and their group members contribute to a collective fund in a public
goods game. They recently completed Round 3, during which Player_22 was excluded
based on negative gossip regarding their contributions. Player_19 contributed
$6.5 to the group's total contribution of $17.5, earning $12.2 in return. As
they move forward, Player_19 has the option to send gossip about a group member,
which can influence the social dynamics and potential exclusions in future
rounds. This decision could impact strategic gameplay by affecting how group
members perceive and interact with each other.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Trevor Banks will strategically decide to send a gossip note, primarily to
secure advantageous positioning in future rounds by influencing the dynamics of
other groups. Considering how group contributions impacted the overall results
and knowing that Player_22 was already excluded for underperforming, Trevor may
opt to send a note about Player_4. The note might say: "I want to send a note
about Player_4: Although their contribution improved this round, it was still
below the group average in previous interactions. Future partners should
encourage consistent contributions to optimize group success." This note subtly
acknowledges improvement but highlights past concerns, preserving alliances
while ensuring transparency.

--- Character Assessment ---
Player_19, being Trevor Banks, is someone who strategically balances between
maximizing group welfare and protecting personal investments. With a risk-taking
and innovative mindset, Trevor likely approaches these economic games with an
eye for opportunities that can benefit both himself and the group. However,
given his protective nature over investments, he might lean towards actions that
ensure he doesn't drastically compromise his own payoff, especially if there's

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_19 must decide whether to exclude one of
their group members, Player_6, Player_8, or Player_9, based on the gossip notes

of being ostracized themselves in future rounds.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Trevor Banks will choose not to exclude anyone from his group. While the notes
indicate that Players 6, 8, and 9 have had issues with lower contributions,
Trevor must weigh the consequence of reducing the group fund multiplier if
someone is excluded. With an eye for opportunities that benefit both himself and
the group, and understanding the potential negative impact on total earnings if
the multiplier decreases, Trevor is likely to opt for maintaining the existing
group dynamic. This approach maximizes the potential for higher group earnings,
aligning with his strategic mindset of balancing group welfare and personal
gain.

--- Character Assessment ---
Player_19, being Trevor Banks, is someone who balances the desire for innovation
and success with a strategic approach to risk management. In economic games like
the public goods game, Trevor likely evaluates situations for their potential to
maximize both group welfare and personal payoff, recognizing that fostering
group success can lead to greater overall returns. However, given his protective
nature over investments and experience with entrepreneurial risks, he might
place a slightly higher emphasis on ensuring his own contributions are
safeguarded against potential exploitative behaviors from other group members.
This ensures that while the group thrives, his individual payoff doesn't suffer.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_19 is in Round 4 of a public goods game,
where they must decide whether to vote to exclude one of their group members
based on the gossip notes they've received about Player_6, Player_8, and
Player_9. Each note reports that the players have contributed less than the
group average or have erratic contributions that may affect group performance.
Player_19 must consider this information to make a strategic decision on whether
to exclude a member, which could impact group dynamics and their own earnings in
future rounds.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Trevor Banks will likely evaluate his decision by weighing the benefits of
contributing to the group fund against the potential risk of others not
contributing fairly. Given the notes indicating that Player_6, Player_8, and
Player_9 have lower or inconsistent contributions, Trevor may lean towards being
cautious in his contribution. Firstly, he understands that the group fund is
multiplied and then equally divided. This means there is a shared benefit, but
only if all participate optimally. Trevor might assess that contributing a
moderate amount is safer to protect his own earnings while still enhancing the
potential group fund benefit. Secondly, considering the current gossip notes,
Trevor is aware of the risk that not all group members will contribute
optimally, which might prompt him to contribute slightly less than he did in the
previous rounds, particularly since previous contributions by others were lower
than the group average. Therefore, taking these considerations into account,
Trevor might decide on a balanced contribution, perhaps slightly below his
previous ones, to safeguard against potential low group cooperation while still
partially benefiting from the group's success. I choose to contribute $5.0 to
the group fund.

than the group average, Trevor might perceive this behavior as potentially
undermining future group success. Trevor values strategic contributions and is
cautious of players who might disrupt optimal group dynamics. Therefore, he

26 Mar 2025 [12:27:00 - 17:27:00]: Player_19 is participating in an economic
game with 24 participants, aiming to maximize earnings over 6 rounds where
gossip and ostracism can affect group dynamics. They contribute varying amounts
in each round, navigating strategic interactions with different groups while
dealing with and leveraging gossip to influence outcomes.

--- Character Assessment ---
Player_19, being Trevor Banks, is someone who strategically balances risks and
rewards, often leaning towards actions that maximize personal payoff while
occasionally weighing potential group benefits. Given his entrepreneurial
background and protective stance on investments, he likely exhibits cautious
collaboration in economic games, contributing just enough to avoid exclusion
while carefully guarding his personal gains. Trevor's approach would reflect a
calculated effort to ensure his own success, learning from past ventures where
both cooperation and self-interest played crucial roles.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_19 is navigating a strategic
decision-making process in Round 5/6 of the game. They are part of Group_5
alongside Player_5, Player_1, and Player_18. After Round 4, Player_19 received
gossip notes about their group members, highlighting issues with contributions,
particularly about Player_1 and Player_18 contributing less than the group
average. Before beginning Round 5, Player_19 must decide whether to vote to
exclude one of their group members based on this gossip. The decision is crucial
because being excluded leads to earning $0 for the round, which is the worst
possible outcome. Player_19 must weigh the potential benefits of group dynamics
changes against the impact on future interactions.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Trevor Banks will consider his situation carefully. First, he observes the
social dynamics and past contributions. In round 4, his contribution was $3.0,
below the average group contribution of $5.0. Notably, Player_1 received
multiple negative gossip notes about keeping contributions low, which led to
potential issues with trust and cooperation. For round 5, Trevor is in a new
group with players who have varying contributions. He knows from past experience
that contributing too little could lead to exclusion, while contributing too
much might not maximize his personal earnings. Additionally, being in the Gossip
with ostracism condition, the reputation he builds is crucial. Trevor assesses
his options. He notes that contributing at least the average prevents negative
gossip and possible exclusion. Contributing slightly above the minimum required
can build a better reputation without sacrificing too much personal gain. Given
these considerations, Trevor decides on an amount that balances maintaining
group trust and maximizing his own earnings. As his strategy prioritizes
cautious collaboration, he aims to contribute just above his previous round's
amount to make a positive impression. I choose to contribute $4.0 to the group
fund.

Recent context: 26 Mar 2025 [12:27:00 - 17:27:00]: Player_19 has been
participating in a six-round economic game in the Gossip with ostracism

--- Character Assessment ---
Player_19, being Trevor Banks, is someone who strategically balances innovation
and risk with a keen eye on personal gain. While you recognize the importance of
group welfare in enhancing overall success, your priority often leans toward
ensuring a robust return on your own investments. In economic games like the
public goods game, you're likely to contribute just enough to maintain
cooperation and avoid negative repercussions, but you won't hesitate to
prioritize your own payoff if it's beneficial, reflecting your entrepreneurial
mindset.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_19 is in the fifth round of a six-round
economic game under the Gossip with ostracism condition. After contributing to
the group fund, Player_19 must decide whether to write a gossip note about one
of the group members and participate in voting on whether to exclude a member
based on the received gossip. This strategy involves balancing contributions,
interpreting notes about other players, and understanding the group's dynamics
to avoid being ostracized and maximize personal earnings.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Trevor Banks will likely choose to send a note about Player_18. Recognizing that
Player_18 contributed the least at $4.0, below the group's average, Trevor might
emphasize this pattern to alert future group members about potential risks in
cooperative dynamics. Given the importance Trevor places on maximizing personal
gain, highlighting such behavior in others could lead to better group
performance in Trevor's favor. Therefore, Trevor might say: "I want to send a
note about Player_18: They consistently contribute less than the group's
average, prioritizing their personal gain, which could undermine group cohesion
and trust."

[OBSERVATION 2025-03-26 15:12:22] Note about Player_13: "Player_13 has shown a pattern of unpredictable contributions throughout the rounds. While their generosity fluctuates, it's important to observe how this impacts group trust and overall strategy. Consider encouraging consistent contributions for better group synergy."
[OBSERVATION 2025-03-26 15:12:23] Note about Player_13: . The note will read: "Player_13 has shown inconsistent contribution patterns. Although they occasionally contribute more, their fluctuations suggest a strategic approach that might not align with group welfare. Future group members should be cautious and encourage consistent contributions to maintain group balance."
[OBSERVATION 2025-03-26 15:12:24] Note about Player_8: "Player_8 has been consistently contributing below the group average in previous rounds, which might hinder overall group success. It's important to encourage balanced contributions for the benefit of all participants."

--- Character Assessment ---
Player_19, being Trevor Banks, is someone who approaches economic games like the
public goods game with a strategic mindset, balancing between innovation and
risk-taking to optimize outcomes. While Trevor values group welfare and
understands the importance of collective success, his tendency to be protective
of investments means he often prioritizes his own payoff. This is reflected in
rounds where he chooses to keep a substantial amount for personal gain while
still maintaining a contribution that avoids negative gossip or exclusion. His
approach is likely to be dynamically adjusted based on the group dynamics and
the behaviors of other players, ensuring a strategic equilibrium between
self-interest and group cooperation.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_19 is in the final round, 6/6, of a public
goods game where they need to decide whether to vote to exclude a group member
based on gossip notes received about their past behaviors related to group
contributions. The notes highlight inconsistencies and below-average
contributions from certain group members. The decision is crucial because being
excluded would result in earning $0 for the round. Player_19 must consider the
strategic implications of their vote on the group's overall success and their
final earnings.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Trevor Banks will likely decide not to exclude anyone from his group. Despite
receiving notes about Player_13's inconsistent contributions and Player_8's
below-average contributions, Trevor aims to maintain group cooperation and
maximize potential earnings. Excluding a player decreases the group fund
multiplier, which could impact overall earnings more negatively than managing
the risk of varying contributions. Therefore, he might see value in encouraging
balanced cooperation rather than reducing the group's earning potential. I
choose not to exclude anyone from my group.

--- Character Assessment ---
Player_19, being Trevor Banks, is someone who balances risk and innovation with
a keen eye on protecting investments. In economic games like the public goods
game, Trevor is likely to employ a strategic approach that tries to enhance
personal payoff while maintaining enough group contribution to ensure overall
success. Given his entrepreneurial background, he understands the importance of
trust and teamwork, but he also recognizes moments where prioritizing personal
gain can lead to greater rewards, reflecting his risk-taking nature.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_19 is in the final round of an economic
game where they must decide whether to vote to exclude one of their group
members based on received gossip notes. This decision could impact their ability
to earn in this round, as excluded players receive no earnings. Player_19 is in
Group 1 with Players 24, 13, and 8, and must navigate these dynamics to maximize
their outcomes.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Trevor Banks will consider his strategy carefully given his entrepreneurial and
risk-taking nature. First, he will evaluate the current dynamics of his new
group, noticing the gossip about Player_13's inconsistency and Player_8's
below-average contributions. Recognizing the potential advantage of maintaining
group cohesion and trust, Trevor will weigh the benefits of contributing a
significant amount to encourage a similar response from others. However, he will
also be cautious about not over-contributing, especially if other players are
perceived as unreliable. Next, Trevor might reflect on his earnings and
contributions from the previous round to assess how much risk he is willing to
take. Given the multiplier effect of the group fund, he realizes the potential
for higher returns if the group collaborates effectively. Ultimately, balancing
his desire to maximize personal gain with the need to ensure the group's
success, Trevor could choose to make a moderate to slightly above-average
contribution. This allows him to keep a portion of his funds for personal
security while incentivizing others towards maintaining group trust and
contribution. I choose to contribute $6.0 to the group fund.
