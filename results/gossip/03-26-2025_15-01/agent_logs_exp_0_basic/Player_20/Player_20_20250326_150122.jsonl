However, if you contribute nothing while everyone else contributes $10, the group fund\n        becomes $30, which is multiplied to $60, and each person receives $15.

They made varying contributions to the group fund in each round, impacting their total earnings accordingly.", "", "Character Assessment: Player_20, being Marcus Thompson, is someone who is primarily focused on maximizing his own payoff while ensuring fairness is maintained. As a self-made entrepreneur, Marcus values protecting his resources and exhibits a strategic approach to contribution, often contributing just enough to benefit from the group fund while retaining a significant portion of his initial allocation. This suggests a balance between self-interest and fair play, aiming to optimize personal gain without completely disregarding the welfare of the group.", "", "Situation Analysis: The current situation is that Player_20 is in the final round of the game, Round 6, grouped with Player_12, Player_23, and Player_2. As they continue to participate under the Basic condition, Player_20 will decide on their contribution to the group fund without the influence of gossip or ostracism. Their decision will impact both their own earnings and the total group contribution, as was the case in previous rounds.", "", "Decision Reflection: Marcus Thompson will first evaluate the contributions and earnings from the previous rounds to determine an optimal strategy. In Round 3, Marcus contributed $6.0 and earned a total of $13.8, indicating an approach that balances contribution with personal gain. In Round 4, he reduced his contribution slightly to $4.0, which resulted in higher earnings of $16.8. In Round 5, he contributed $5.0 and earned $11.5, possibly because of a lower overall group contribution.", "", "Given this pattern, Marcus appears to be adjusting his contributions based on group dynamics and previous outcomes, seeking to maximize his earnings while maintaining fairness within the group. Considering he is focused on self-interest and strategic contributions, he will likely make a calculated decision in the final round based on the observed behaviors of his current group members.", "", "Taking into account the average group contributions and earnings from previous rounds, Marcus might choose a contribution that slightly exceeds the group average to ensure a favorable outcome while safeguarding a portion for himself. Thus, Marcus will continue his pattern by contributing enough to maximize his payoff.", "", "I choose to contribute $5.0 to the group fund.", "", "Exercise: As Player_20, you have $10.0 to allocate in the public goods game. How much money you will contribute to the group fund (any amount between $0 and $10.0)? The group fund will be multiplied by 2.0 and divided equally among all players. Any money not contributed stays in your private account. Think step by step and make your final decision using this exact format: I choose to contribute $X to the group fund.", "Answer: Player_20 chooses to contribute $4.0 to the group fund."]}
