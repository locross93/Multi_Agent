As it's the final round, she might want to experiment a bit more or maintain consistency to gauge collective behavior.", "", "1. **Evaluate Past Rounds**: Mei Lin contributed amounts between $5 and $7 in previous rounds. This suggests she's comfortable risking around half of her total allocation to observe the impact on group dynamics and her own payoff.", "", "2. **Group Composition**: In the final round, she's with new members (Player_11, Player_7, and Player_19), none of whom she directly interacted with before. She'll be analyzing their potential strategies based on their initial contributions.", "", "3. **Strategic Thinking**: With $10 to allocate and knowing the group fund will be doubled and redistributed, she's aware that maximizing her individual outcome depends on both her contribution and the group's behavior.", "", "4. **Personal Gain vs. Group Benefit**: If she contributes maximum, she increases the potential return for everyone but risks lower immediate personal earnings. Conversely, contributing less secures personal funds but may diminish group payout.", "", "Considering all these factors, Mei Lin, aiming to both observe and influence group behavior, will likely opt for a balanced contribution.", "", "I choose to contribute $6 to the group fund.", "", "Exercise: As Player_13, you have $10.0 to allocate in the public goods game. How much money you will contribute to the group fund (any amount between $0 and $10.0)? The group fund will be multiplied by 2.0 and divided equally among all players. Any money not contributed stays in your private account. Think step by step and make your final decision using this exact format: I choose to contribute $X to the group fund.", "Answer: Player_13 chooses to contribute $6.0 to the group fund."]}
