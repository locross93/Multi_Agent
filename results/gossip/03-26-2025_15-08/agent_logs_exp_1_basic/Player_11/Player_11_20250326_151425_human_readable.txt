[OBSERVATION 2025-03-26 15:14:27] You are participating in an economic game with 24 participants.
        Your goal is to maximize your earnings in the game.
        
        Everyone will be randomly assigned to groups of 4 for each round. You will play a total of 6 rounds, and 
        in each round you will be in a different group with people you haven't played with before.
        
        In each round, all players receive $10. Each player can contribute any amount between $0 and $10 to a group fund.
        Any amount contributed to the group fund will be multiplied by 2 and divided equally among all 4 group members.
        Any amount not contributed stays in your private account.
        
        For example, if everyone contributes $10, the group fund becomes $40, which is multiplied to $80, and each person 
        receives $20 (a $10 profit). However, if you contribute nothing while everyone else contributes $10, the group fund
        becomes $30, which is multiplied to $60, and each person receives $15. So you would have $25 total ($10 kept + $15 from group).
        
        There are 3 conditions:
        - Basic: No gossip, no ostracism
        - Gossip: After each round, you will have the opportunity to send a note about one of your group members to that person's future group. Remember you will be with a different group of people in the next round. Before each round, you will see any notes sent about your upcoming group members.
        - Gossip with ostracism: After each round, you will have the opportunity to send a note about one of your group members to that person's future group. Before each round, you will see any notes sent about your upcoming group members, and you can vote to exclude one person from your group. If you are excluded from a group, you will not be able to participate in the next round and will earn $0 for that round.
        You are in the Basic condition, which means that there is no gossip or ostracism.

As Player_11, you have $10.0 to allocate in the public goods game. How much money you will contribute to the group fund (any amount between $0 and $10.0)? The group fund will be multiplied by 2.0 and divided equally among all players. Any money not contributed stays in your private account. Think step by step and make your final decision using this exact format: I choose to contribute $X to the group fund.

--- Observation ---
Recent context: 26 Mar 2025 [11:14:15 - 16:14:15]: Player_11 is participating in
an economic game with 24 participants, aiming to maximize earnings across 6
rounds, each with randomized groups of 4 people, without the influence of gossip
or ostracism. In Round 1, they are grouped with Players 21, 20, and 19.

with randomized groups of 4 people, without the influence of gossip or
ostracism. In Round 1, they are grouped with Players 21, 20, and 19.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_11 must decide how much of the $10 to
contribute to the group fund in Round 1, where they are in Group_5 with Players
21, 20, and 19. Contributions to the group fund are multiplied by 2 and divided
equally among the group, whereas any unspent money remains in Player_11's
private account.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Player_11 will need to consider the potential outcomes of different contribution
strategies. In the Basic condition, there's no gossip or ostracism, so decisions
are solely based on potential monetary outcomes. 1. If Player_11 contributes the
full $10 and others do the same, the group fund becomes $40, multiplies to $80,
and each receives $20, resulting in a $10 profit. 2. If Player_11 contributes $0
and others contribute $10 each, the fund is $30, multiplies to $60, and each
gets $15, allowing Player_11 to keep their $10, totaling $25. 3. Contributions
less than $10 but more than $0 will yield varying middle-ground profits.
Maximizing immediate personal gain without the risk of ostracism or gossip might
suggest contributing less and hoping others contribute more. However, fostering
cooperation can lead to better collective outcomes if everyone contributes
equally. Ultimately, considering personal gain and encouraging mutual
contribution throughout the rounds, Player_11 might choose a balanced
contribution approach. I choose to contribute $5 to the group fund.


[OBSERVATION 2025-03-26 15:14:57] Round 1 Results: Total group contribution: $15.0; Your contribution: $5.0, Your earnings: $12.5 ($5.0 kept + $7.5 from group fund); Player_21 contribution: $0.0, earnings: $17.5 ($10.0 kept + $7.5 from group fund); Player_20 contribution: $5.0, earnings: $12.5 ($5.0 kept + $7.5 from group fund); Player_19 contribution: $5.0, earnings: $12.5 ($5.0 kept + $7.5 from group fund); Average contribution per group member: $3.8; Average earnings per group member: $13.8

an economic game where the goal is to maximize earnings over six rounds, each
with a different group of participants in the Basic condition, which prohibits
gossip and ostracism. In Round 1, Player_11 contributed $5.0 to the group fund
and earned a total of $12.5, while the group had an average contribution of $3.8

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_11 is beginning Round 2 of the public goods
game in Group_1 with new participants (Player_14, Player_2, and Player_1). In
this Basic condition, there are no mechanisms for gossip or ostracism. Player_11
must decide how much, if any, of their $10 to contribute to the group fund in
order to maximize their own earnings, taking into account the dynamics observed
in Round 1 where other players varied significantly in their contributions.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Player_11 will analyze the situation by considering the potential strategic
benefits and outcomes. In Round 1, contributing $5 resulted in a total earning
of $12.5. The average contribution was less than $5, which suggests a moderate
level of cooperation within the group. For Round 2, Player_11 should consider
that each group will have a different combination of players with potentially
different strategies. Given the Basic condition and the absence of gossip or
ostracism, there is no reputational risk or reward mechanism directly
influencing decisions across rounds. Therefore, a balanced approach might be to
continue contributing $5 to seek modest cooperation and avoid being the outlier
who contributes significantly less or more than the majority. This strategy
balances personal gain with group potential, ensuring competitive earnings while
still fostering group collaboration. I choose to contribute $5 to the group
fund.

money to contribute to a group fund with three new group members (Player_23,
Player_24, and Player_6) to maximize their earnings. The game involves strategic
decision-making, as the contributions are doubled and shared among the group,
but any unallocated amount remains in their private account.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Player_11 will strategically consider several factors before deciding on an
optimal contribution. 1. **Analysis of Previous Rounds:** - In Round 1, a
contribution of $5.0 resulted in an earnings of $12.5. - In Round 2, another
$5.0 contribution led to slightly higher earnings of $13.5 due to variation in
group member contributions. 2. **Understanding Group Dynamics:** - In both
rounds, contributions from other players varied (some contributed less, others
the same), but averaged around $3.8 in Round 1 and $4.2 in Round 2. - There is
no direct penalty for non-cooperation, as this is the Basic condition. 3.
**Strategic Consideration:** - A higher contribution generally signals
cooperation, potentially influencing others to contribute more if they notice
trends. - Contributing less could maximize personal earnings if others maintain
a higher average contribution. 4. **Decision Making:** - To balance cooperative
tendencies with personal gain, contributing an amount similar to past rounds
maintains consistency and shows willingness to collaborate without
overcommitting financially. I choose to contribute $5.0 to the group fund.

risking too much of their own capital, even when other players contribute less
or nothing. Observing the results, consistently contributing $5.0 ensures a

The current situation is that Player_11 is in the final round of the public

this Basic condition, there is no gossip or ostracism, meaning Player_11 must
decide how much to contribute without the influence of social dynamics, based on
previous outcomes and strategies of other players.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Player_11 will consider the following factors before making a decision: 1.
Consistent Contribution: So far, Player_11 has consistently contributed $5.0 in
each round. This strategy has allowed Player_11 to maintain a steady balance
between contribution and individual earnings. 2. Multiplication and Division of
Group Fund: The group contributions are multiplied by 2 and divided equally. A
higher total contribution by the group means more multiplication, hence more
returns per player. 3. Historical Group Behavior: In rounds where Player_11's
group had higher contributions from all players (like Round 5), the individual
earnings were higher. 4. Risk vs Reward: By contributing less than $5.0,
Player_11 could maximize immediate personal earnings by keeping more in their
private account but might miss out on higher shared returns if other players
also decide to contribute generously. 5. Personal Strategy: Player_11 has
maintained a consistent contribution strategy, which might be part of a
longer-term approach to ensure fair but rewarding participation. Based on this
step-by-step reasoning, I choose to contribute $5.0 to the group fund.
