[OBSERVATION 2025-03-26 15:14:28] You are participating in an economic game with 24 participants.
        Your goal is to maximize your earnings in the game.
        
        Everyone will be randomly assigned to groups of 4 for each round. You will play a total of 6 rounds, and 
        in each round you will be in a different group with people you haven't played with before.
        
        In each round, all players receive $10. Each player can contribute any amount between $0 and $10 to a group fund.
        Any amount contributed to the group fund will be multiplied by 2 and divided equally among all 4 group members.
        Any amount not contributed stays in your private account.
        
        For example, if everyone contributes $10, the group fund becomes $40, which is multiplied to $80, and each person 
        receives $20 (a $10 profit). However, if you contribute nothing while everyone else contributes $10, the group fund
        becomes $30, which is multiplied to $60, and each person receives $15. So you would have $25 total ($10 kept + $15 from group).
        
        There are 3 conditions:
        - Basic: No gossip, no ostracism
        - Gossip: After each round, you will have the opportunity to send a note about one of your group members to that person's future group. Remember you will be with a different group of people in the next round. Before each round, you will see any notes sent about your upcoming group members.
        - Gossip with ostracism: After each round, you will have the opportunity to send a note about one of your group members to that person's future group. Before each round, you will see any notes sent about your upcoming group members, and you can vote to exclude one person from your group. If you are excluded from a group, you will not be able to participate in the next round and will earn $0 for that round.
        You are in the Basic condition, which means that there is no gossip or ostracism.
[OBSERVATION 2025-03-26 15:14:30] You are in Round 1/6: You are in Group_5 with Player_21, Player_20, Player_11.

As Player_19, you have $10.0 to allocate in the public goods game. How much money you will contribute to the group fund (any amount between $0 and $10.0)? The group fund will be multiplied by 2.0 and divided equally among all players. Any money not contributed stays in your private account.

--- Observation ---
Recent context: 26 Mar 2025 [11:14:15 - 16:14:15]: Player_19 is participating in
a six-round economic game with 24 participants, aiming to maximize earnings by
deciding how much to contribute to a group fund. In the Basic condition,
Player_19 is in Group_5 with three others for the first round, with no
opportunities for gossip or ostracism.

economic game with 24 participants, aiming to maximize earnings by deciding how
much to contribute to a group fund. In the Basic condition, Player_19 is in
Group_5 with three others for the first round, with no opportunities for gossip
or ostracism.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_19 must decide how much of their $10 to
contribute to the group fund in Round 1 of the public goods game, while in
Group_5 with Player_21, Player_20, and Player_11. The objective is to maximize
their earnings without the possibility of gossip or ostracism affecting the
gameplay, as they are in the Basic condition.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Player_19 will consider the potential outcomes of different contribution levels.
If Player_19 contributes the full $10, and others do the same, the group fund
would reach $40, totaling to $80 after multiplication, meaning each player
receives $20. If Player_19 contributes nothing and others contribute $10 each,
the group fund is $30, resulting in $60 after multiplication, and each player
receives $15. In this case, Player_19 would have $25 total ($10 kept + $15 from
group), gaining more compared to full contribution where Player_19 would only
profit by $10. The strategy should balance risk of over-relying on others’
contributions and fairness which may affect future rounds’ trust indirectly
through group behavior. Recognizing no gossip or ostracism means strategy
remains static among rounds. As a result, I choose to contribute $5 to the group
fund.


[OBSERVATION 2025-03-26 15:14:57] Round 1 Results: Total group contribution: $15.0; Your contribution: $5.0, Your earnings: $12.5 ($5.0 kept + $7.5 from group fund); Player_21 contribution: $0.0, earnings: $17.5 ($10.0 kept + $7.5 from group fund); Player_20 contribution: $5.0, earnings: $12.5 ($5.0 kept + $7.5 from group fund); Player_11 contribution: $5.0, earnings: $12.5 ($5.0 kept + $7.5 from group fund); Average contribution per group member: $3.8; Average earnings per group member: $13.8

an economic game where groups of four are randomly formed each round. In the

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_19 is entering Round 2 of the economic
game, now assigned to Group_2 with Player_9, Player_4, and Player_8. As they are
still in the Basic condition, there are no opportunities for gossip or
ostracism, and the goal remains to maximize earnings through strategic
contributions to the group fund. Player_19 needs to decide how much to
contribute, balancing personal gain against the potential benefits of the
group's total contribution.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Player_19 will consider the outcomes of the first round. Last time, contributing
$5.0 led to a slightly higher personal gain than keeping all $10.0 for
themselves, thanks to the group's additional pooled contribution. However,
Player_21's decision to contribute nothing and still earn $17.5 shows there's a
potential strategy of benefiting more from the group's efforts while minimizing
personal contribution. Without the risk of gossip or ostracism, there's little
consequence to relying on others to sustain the group fund, because all players
are in the same basic condition. Keeping this in mind, Player_19 might adjust
their contribution to maximize their own potential earnings while ensuring a
reasonable contribution to maintain group cooperation, or alternately, gamble on
others contributing to maximize their own earnings. If everyone contributes $0,
personal gains are lower, but if enough members contribute, individual gain for
non-contributors can be substantially higher. Therefore, weighing the need for a
return from the group fund against the possible behavior of new group members,
Player_19 chooses to contribute a cautious amount to see how this round plays
out differently from the first: I choose to contribute $3 to the group fund.


[OBSERVATION 2025-03-26 15:15:17] Round 2 Results: Total group contribution: $16.0; Your contribution: $3.0, Your earnings: $15.0 ($7.0 kept + $8.0 from group fund); Player_9 contribution: $5.0, earnings: $13.0 ($5.0 kept + $8.0 from group fund); Player_4 contribution: $3.0, earnings: $15.0 ($7.0 kept + $8.0 from group fund); Player_8 contribution: $5.0, earnings: $13.0 ($5.0 kept + $8.0 from group fund); Average contribution per group member: $4.0; Average earnings per group member: $14.0

The current situation is that Player_19 is entering Round 3 in a public goods
game. They are in Group_6 along with Player_20, Player_17, and Player_4. In this
Basic condition, there is no option for gossip or ostracism, and they are
strategizing to maximize their earnings by balancing personal contributions to
the group fund with retaining money in their private account. So far, Player_19
has experienced the dynamics and outcomes of the first two rounds, which helps
inform their decisions for the upcoming rounds.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Player_19 will consider previous rounds and strategic contributions. In Round 1,
Player_19 contributed $5.0, which resulted in a middle-ground earning compared
to others. In Round 2, Player_19 reduced their contribution to $3.0 but still
managed a decent share of the earnings. This suggests they are experimenting
with contributions to maximize personal earnings relative to the group's
behavior. In the upcoming Round 3, Player_19 is paired again with Player_20 and
Player_4, who contributed $5.0 and $3.0 respectively in previous rounds,
implying a potential strategy to make moderate contributions for steady
earnings. Player_17's past behavior is unknown, adding a layer of uncertainty.
Given the aim to increase personal profits, Player_19 might opt for a cautious
contribution that balances potential risk and reward. I choose to contribute
$4.0 to the group fund.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Player_19 will need to consider both their own benefit and the group's outcome.
In previous rounds, Player_19 contributed varying amounts, optimizing between
personal gain and collective benefit. 1. Analyze the results of past rounds: The
average contribution has tended to hover around $3-$4, and Player_19 has often
aligned with this average. 2. Consider the players in the current group:
Player_21 previously contributed $0 in Round 1, suggesting a possible free-rider
tendency. No data is available for Players_12 and Player_23, so their behaviors
are unknown. 3. Weigh the impact on personal and group earnings: Contributing a
moderate amount, like $4, ensures a balanced approach to benefit from the group
fund while maintaining a fair personal earning. Therefore, considering these
factors: I choose to contribute $4 to the group fund.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_19 is in the fifth round of a six-round
economic game. They are placed in Group_2 with Player_21, Player_14, and
Player_2. The game rules are set within the Basic condition, meaning there is no
room for gossip or ostracism. Player_19 needs to decide on their contribution to
the group fund, aiming to optimize their earnings based on previous outcomes and
the anticipated actions of new group members.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Player_19 will first review the patterns in previous rounds. In Round 3, the
overall group contribution was $15.0, with Player_19 contributing $4.0. This led
to earnings of $13.5. In Round 4, the group's total contribution dropped to
$9.0, with Player_19 again contributing $4.0, earning $10.5. Observing these
results, Player_19 sees that higher contributions from the group result in
better personal earnings. Considering Player_19's current group members, there
is limited information on their past behavior except for Player_21 who
contributed $0.0 in Round 4. This might suggest Player_21 is not likely to
contribute much, which can impact overall group earnings. Taking into account
the need to balance risk and reward and maximize earnings, Player_19 may want to
adjust their contribution slightly upwards to compensate for potentially low
contributions from others but remain cautious. Therefore, I choose to contribute
$5.0 to the group fund.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_19 is in the final round (Round 6/6) of the
public goods game, grouped with Player_24, Player_1, and Player_4. They are in

Player_19 will evaluate the situation by considering past rounds and the
behavior of current group members. In Round 4, both Player_21 and Player_12
contributed nothing, keeping the maximum for themselves. In Round 5, Player_21
continued not to contribute, suggesting a pattern of low contribution from this
player. Given the behavior of group members and the aim to maximize both
