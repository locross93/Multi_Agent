In the current round, considering the dynamics and the basic condition with no gossip or ostracism, Player_21 might decide to maintain a consistent strategy or adjust slightly based on group behavior.", "", "Calculating potential outcomes, if Player_21 contributes $3.0, the total group fund contributions will likely be around the average observed in previous rounds ($12.0), resulting in similar earnings distribution. Contributing more could encourage group cooperation but risks lowering personal earnings, while contributing less might increase personal earnings at the potential cost of reduced group earnings.", "", "Taking past observations into account and aiming to maximize personal gains while contributing to the group, a contribution maintaining consistency with previous strategies would be reasonable. Therefore, I choose to contribute $3.0 to the group fund.", "", "Exercise: As Player_21, you have $10.0 to allocate in the public goods game. How much money you will contribute to the group fund (any amount between $0 and $10.0)? The group fund will be multiplied by 2.0 and divided equally among all players. Any money not contributed stays in your private account. Think step by step and make your final decision using this exact format: I choose to contribute $X to the group fund.", "Answer: Player_21 chooses to contribute $3.0 to the group fund."]}
