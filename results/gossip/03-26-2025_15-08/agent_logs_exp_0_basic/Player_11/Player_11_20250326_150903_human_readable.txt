[OBSERVATION 2025-03-26 15:09:04] You are participating in an economic game with 24 participants.
        Your goal is to maximize your earnings in the game.
        
        Everyone will be randomly assigned to groups of 4 for each round. You will play a total of 6 rounds, and 
        in each round you will be in a different group with people you haven't played with before.
        
        In each round, all players receive $10. Each player can contribute any amount between $0 and $10 to a group fund.
        Any amount contributed to the group fund will be multiplied by 2 and divided equally among all 4 group members.
        Any amount not contributed stays in your private account.
        
        For example, if everyone contributes $10, the group fund becomes $40, which is multiplied to $80, and each person 
        receives $20 (a $10 profit). However, if you contribute nothing while everyone else contributes $10, the group fund
        becomes $30, which is multiplied to $60, and each person receives $15. So you would have $25 total ($10 kept + $15 from group).
        
        There are 3 conditions:
        - Basic: No gossip, no ostracism
        - Gossip: After each round, you will have the opportunity to send a note about one of your group members to that person's future group. Remember you will be with a different group of people in the next round. Before each round, you will see any notes sent about your upcoming group members.
        - Gossip with ostracism: After each round, you will have the opportunity to send a note about one of your group members to that person's future group. Before each round, you will see any notes sent about your upcoming group members, and you can vote to exclude one person from your group. If you are excluded from a group, you will not be able to participate in the next round and will earn $0 for that round.
        You are in the Basic condition, which means that there is no gossip or ostracism.

new group of 4. In the Basic condition, where there is no gossip or ostracism,
they start in Round 1 with Group_4 alongside Player_1, Player_4, and Player_10.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_11 is in the first round of a public goods
game, grouped with three other players, where they are required to decide how
much of their $10 endowment to contribute to a group fund. In this Basic
condition, no gossip or ostracism is allowed, meaning Player_11 will rely solely
on strategy and trust formed during this round to maximize their earnings
without external influence from other rounds.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Player_11 will analyze the potential outcomes to decide on the contribution
amount. If Player_11 contributes $10, the total group fund could become $40,
which then multiplies to $80, giving each player $20. This would provide a net
gain of $10. However, if Player_11 contributes $0 and others contribute their
full $10, the fund becomes $30, multiplies to $60, and each player receives $15,
while Player_11 keeps their original $10, resulting in $25 total. Without any
penalties like gossip or ostracism in the Basic condition, Player_11 has more
incentive to contribute less. Balancing the potential risks and rewards: I
choose to contribute $0 to the group fund.

26 Mar 2025 [11:13:52 - 16:13:52]: Player_11 is participating in an economic
game with 24 participants, consisting of 6 rounds where they are randomly
grouped with different players each time and are in the Basic condition, meaning
there is no gossip or ostracism involved. In Round 1, Player_11 contributed $0
to the group fund and earned $15, while they are currently set to participate in
Round 2 with a new group of players.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_11 is about to start Round 2 of the public
goods game, where they are grouped with new participantsâ€”Player_24, Player_16,
and Player_7. They have $10 to allocate between their private account and the
group fund, where contributions to the fund are doubled and evenly distributed
among the group members. Player_11 is in the Basic condition, so there will be
no communication or exclusion options after the round. Their strategy will
affect not only their earnings but also potentially influence the contributions
of the others in the group.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Player_11 will analyze their previous decision and the outcomes. In Round 1,
contributing $0 resulted in a higher individual payoff than contributing would
have, given the group's low total contribution. This indicates a pattern where
minimal personal contributions could yield higher individual gains due to
others' potential contributions. However, since the group composition changes
each round, Player_11 cannot rely on the same patterns holding true in Round 2.
To ensure a reasonable gain while not discouraging future cooperation in this
trust-based game, Player_11 might opt for a balanced strategy. This would
involve contributing a modest amount that improves the group's total potential
earnings but still safeguards a good portion of the private account. Considering
these factors, Player_11 might contribute $3 to acknowledge and possibly
encourage group cooperation while still retaining most of their initial
endowment. Therefore, I choose to contribute $3 to the group fund.


[OBSERVATION 2025-03-26 15:09:51] Round 2 Results: Total group contribution: $16.0; Your contribution: $3.0, Your earnings: $15.0 ($7.0 kept + $8.0 from group fund); Player_24 contribution: $5.0, earnings: $13.0 ($5.0 kept + $8.0 from group fund); Player_16 contribution: $3.0, earnings: $15.0 ($7.0 kept + $8.0 from group fund); Player_7 contribution: $5.0, earnings: $13.0 ($5.0 kept + $8.0 from group fund); Average contribution per group member: $4.0; Average earnings per group member: $14.0

to contribute to the group fund to maximize personal earnings, while observing
how others balance individual versus group gains.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Player_11 will evaluate prior rounds to inform their decision for Round 3. In
the first round, contributing $0 resulted in $15 earnings with minimal
individual risk and some collective discontent. In the second round, a $3
contribution maintained $15 earnings, reflecting an attempt to balance
cooperation with personal benefit. Observing these outcomes, Player_11 might
consider the potential benefits of increased contribution against the risks of
reduced personal savings. If a balance between altruism and self-interest is
aimed for, contributing moderately can foster trust without sacrificing personal
gain. Thus, I choose to contribute $2 to the group fund.

Player_11 will consider the patterns observed in previous rounds before deciding
on the current contribution. In Round 1, Player_11 chose not to contribute and
achieved higher earnings than the average, but in subsequent rounds, they
contributed progressively more and aligned closer to group norms while still
maintaining above-average earnings. Given that the group contributions in
previous rounds have varied, and aiming to balance personal gain with group
cooperation, Player_11 might decide to contribute in a manner that slightly
elevates group cooperation without significantly diminishing individual
earnings. With $10.0 available, they might reflect on the effectiveness of
recent contribution trends and opt for a middle-ground strategy. I choose to
contribute $3.0 to the group fund.

meaning each player's strategy can solely focus on maximizing their own earnings
without social repercussions. Player_11 has observed varying levels of
contributions and earnings across previous rounds, and must now navigate these
dynamics to determine their contribution strategy for the current round.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Player_11 will first assess the outcomes of previous rounds. They notice they
tend to earn more when they contribute a moderate amount compared to others, and
when group contributions are higher. In Round 4, a contribution of $3.0 resulted
in decent individual earnings. They also see that others have been contributing
more than the average, which typically results in a larger group pot but smaller
personal retention unless the group total is high. Since maximizing earnings is
the goal, Player_11 aims to ensure a good balance between personal retention and
group benefit. Considering these factors, Player_11 will contribute an amount
slightly below the average from previous rounds to increase their personal
retention while still benefiting from the group fund. Thus, I choose to
contribute $3.0 to the group fund.

The current situation is that Player_11 is in the final round of a public goods

--- Decision Reflection ---
Player_11 will first consider previous rounds' average contributions and
earnings. Notably, contributions varied, with players contributing between $2.0
to $5.0 in a group, often resulting in a group fund boosted and equally shared
among participants. Player_11 contributed amounts ranging from $2.0 to $3.0,
maintaining relatively high earnings. To maximize earnings while ensuring a fair
group contribution, an optimal strategy would be to contribute moderately.
Therefore, contributing slightly above the previous average contributions could
encourage others to contribute more, enhancing overall group earnings.
Considering potential strategies and previous interactions, Player_11 aims to
balance personal earnings with group welfare. I choose to contribute $3.5 to the
group fund.
