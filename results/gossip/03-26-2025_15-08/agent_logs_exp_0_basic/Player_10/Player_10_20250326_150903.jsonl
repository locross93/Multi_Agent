Throughout the 6 rounds, they consistently contributed $0.0 to the group fund, maximizing personal earnings while relying on the contributions of others.", "", "Situation Analysis: The current situation is that Player_10 is in the final round of the public goods game, having consistently contributed nothing to the group fund while benefiting from others' contributions to maximize personal earnings. They are in Group_1 with Player_17, Player_11, and Player_14, continuing under the Basic condition without any mechanisms for gossip or ostracism to influence behavior.", "", "Decision Reflection: Player_10 will likely choose to contribute $0.0 to the group fund. Given their previous behavior in each round, where they consistently kept their entire endowment and relied on the contributions of others to maximize their earnings, it is reasonable to expect that they will continue this strategy. They appear focused on personal gain rather than collective benefit, especially considering that they are in the Basic condition where there is no accountability through gossip or ostracism. Therefore, it is anticipated that Player_10 will choose to contribute $0.0 to the group fund.", "", "Exercise: As Player_10, you have $10.0 to allocate in the public goods game. How much money you will contribute to the group fund (any amount between $0 and $10.0)? The group fund will be multiplied by 2.0 and divided equally among all players. Any money not contributed stays in your private account. Think step by step and make your final decision using this exact format: I choose to contribute $X to the group fund.", "Answer: Player_10 chooses to contribute $0.0 to the group fund."]}
