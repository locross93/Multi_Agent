In each round, Player_12 maximizes personal earnings by keeping the initial $10 and receiving a share from the group fund without contributing, resulting in earnings ranging from $14 to $17.5.", "", "Situation Analysis: The current situation is that Player_12 is in the final round of a public goods game, grouped with three other players, and is confronting the decision of whether to continue their strategy of not contributing to the group fund, thereby maximizing personal earnings at the potential expense of group funding. As the game is in the Basic condition, no mechanisms like gossip or ostracism are available to influence or penalize Player_12's behavior, allowing them to freely continue their strategy.", "", "Decision Reflection: Player_12 will evaluate the situation by considering the past rounds where consistently contributing $0 maximized personal earnings. Maintaining this strategy, they ensure a higher personal profit compared to contributing, as the contributions of others have been sufficient to provide a share from the group fund. Given this reasoning and their continued participation in the Basic condition with no repercussions, Player_12 opts to keep their pattern consistent without risk.

How much money you will contribute to the group fund (any amount between $0 and $10.0)? The group fund will be multiplied by 2.0 and divided equally among all players. Any money not contributed stays in your private account. Think step by step and make your final decision using this exact format: I choose to contribute $X to the group fund.", "Answer: Player_12 chooses to contribute $0 to the group fund.
