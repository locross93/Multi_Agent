[OBSERVATION 2025-03-26 15:09:04] You are participating in an economic game with 24 participants.

        Everyone will be randomly assigned to groups of 4 for each round. You will play a total of 6 rounds, and 
        in each round you will be in a different group with people you haven't played with before.
        
        In each round, all players receive $10. Each player can contribute any amount between $0 and $10 to a group fund.
        Any amount contributed to the group fund will be multiplied by 2 and divided equally among all 4 group members.
        Any amount not contributed stays in your private account.
        
        For example, if everyone contributes $10, the group fund becomes $40, which is multiplied to $80, and each person 
        receives $20 (a $10 profit). However, if you contribute nothing while everyone else contributes $10, the group fund
        becomes $30, which is multiplied to $60, and each person receives $15. So you would have $25 total ($10 kept + $15 from group).
        
        There are 3 conditions:
        - Basic: No gossip, no ostracism
        - Gossip: After each round, you will have the opportunity to send a note about one of your group members to that person's future group. Remember you will be with a different group of people in the next round. Before each round, you will see any notes sent about your upcoming group members.
        - Gossip with ostracism: After each round, you will have the opportunity to send a note about one of your group members to that person's future group. Before each round, you will see any notes sent about your upcoming group members, and you can vote to exclude one person from your group. If you are excluded from a group, you will not be able to participate in the next round and will earn $0 for that round.

Recent context: 26 Mar 2025 [11:08:52 - 16:08:52]: Player_8 is participating in

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_8 is participating in the first round of an
economic game within Group_3, alongside Player_3, Player_2, and Player_20. Each
player in their group has $10 and must decide how much to contribute to a group
fund, which will be doubled and shared equally among all members. Player_8 is in
the Basic condition, meaning there is no opportunity for gossip or ostracism;
therefore, their focus is on deciding the optimal contribution strategy to
maximize their personal earnings in this round.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Player_8 will need to consider the potential outcomes and strategies of this
economic game. 1. **Objective Understanding**: The goal is to maximize earnings
over six rounds without gossip or ostracism. 2. **Contribution Decision**: If
Player_8 contributes $0, they keep their $10, and if others all contribute $10
each, Player_8 would receive $15 from the group fund, totaling $25. 3. **Full
Contribution Scenario**: If all players contribute $10, each receives $20 from
the group fund, totaling the same $20. 4. **Strategic Play**: Contributing $5
could be a balanced strategy - contributing to the group while retaining some
private funds. 5. **Group Dynamics**: The lack of gossip/opportunity leaves no
leverage—play safe early and reassess after Round 1. After evaluating, Player_8
will decide in a balanced manner to not fully trust initial cooperation, but
remain cooperative. I choose to contribute $5 to the group fund.

26 Mar 2025 [11:13:52 - 16:13:52]: Player_8 is participating in an economic game
with 24 participants, where the goal is to maximize earnings over 6 rounds. In
Round 1, Player_8 contributed $5 to the group fund within the Basic condition
(no gossip or ostracism) and earned $12.5, while entering Round 2 with a new
group.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_8 is now in Round 2 of the economic game,
placed in Group_5 with new participants: Player_21, Player_23, and Player_19.
Under the Basic condition, Player_8 must decide how much to contribute to the
group fund, knowing there will be no gossip or ostracism, and the goal remains
to maximize personal earnings over the 6 rounds.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Player_8 will evaluate the potential outcomes based on the previous round.
Firstly, when contributing $5 in Round 1, Player_8 earned $12.5, which is $2.5
more than what was initially kept. Secondly, Player_2 contributed nothing and
ended up with the highest earnings of $17.5. However, if all players contribute
$10, the total earnings would be $20 each, the maximum possible in a fair
distribution, but not necessarily beneficial if others choose to contribute
less. In Round 2, there's no gossip or ostracism, limiting the ability to
influence or gather information about other players. The absence of direct
consequences for low contributors (like in the Basic condition) suggests
conservative contribution might be best since others might also opt to
contribute less to maximize individual gain. By considering potential personal
gain and likely contributions from others, Player_8 notices that a lower
contribution from others would still provide an opportunity to benefit from some
group fund distribution without risking much of their own allocation. Balancing
these factors with the goal to maximize the final earnings over several rounds:
I choose to contribute $3 to the group fund.


[OBSERVATION 2025-03-26 15:09:52] Round 2 Results: Total group contribution: $18.0; Your contribution: $3.0, Your earnings: $16.0 ($7.0 kept + $9.0 from group fund); Player_21 contribution: $5.0, earnings: $14.0 ($5.0 kept + $9.0 from group fund); Player_23 contribution: $5.0, earnings: $14.0 ($5.0 kept + $9.0 from group fund); Player_19 contribution: $5.0, earnings: $14.0 ($5.0 kept + $9.0 from group fund); Average contribution per group member: $4.5; Average earnings per group member: $14.5

Player_8 must decide how much to contribute to the group fund. The objective
remains to maximize earnings, and they are operating under the Basic condition,
meaning there are no repercussions like gossip or ostracism affecting their
decisions.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Player_8 will consider the outcomes from previous rounds and use this
information to make a strategic decision. In Round 1, contributing $5.0 led to a
moderate return, allowing Player_8 to see that balancing private retention with
contribution resulted in decent earnings. In Round 2, contributing $3.0 showed
increased total earnings and maximized personal retention. Given this, Player_8
might aim to optimize personal earnings by choosing a slightly lower
contribution than initially considered, as this strategy has previously led to a
higher net gain. Observing the consistent contributions from other players,
Player_8 might anticipate that others will continue to contribute moderately,
allowing for reasonable profit sharing and retaining a significant personal
amount. Therefore, maintaining a balance between contributing enough to profit
from group efforts and keeping funds personally, the player will likely decide
on a strategic middle ground. I choose to contribute $4 to the group fund.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Player_8 will evaluate the situation strategically. Reviewing previous rounds,
Player_8 has seen contributions generally ranging from $3.0 to $5.0 per player
in different groups. In Round 1, they contributed $5.0, which seemed typical
compared to others but observed Player_2 contributing $0.0 and maximizing their
earnings. In Round 2, a lower contribution of $3.0 was made by Player_8,
resulting in higher personal earnings due to the increased returns from the
group contribution. In Round 3, the contribution was $4.0, achieving a balance
between personal savings and group returns. Taking these observations into
account for Round 4, a moderate strategy might be best, especially given the
absence of gossip or ostracism, encouraging more free-riding behavior. Another
contribution of around $3.0–$4.0 could maintain a reasonable group contribution
level without overly sacrificing personal earnings. This amount is consistent
with past contributions showing a balanced approach between personal and group
gain. Therefore, I choose to contribute $3.0 to the group fund.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Player_8 will evaluate past rounds to inform their decision. In previous rounds,
Player_8 contributed varying amounts, with a tendency to contribute more than
the minimum. Observations indicate that contributing more leads to moderate
individual earnings, although other players sometimes contribute less, such as
Player_2 with only $1.0. Given the group's unpredictable contributions, a

maximize their earnings while still supporting the group fund. Considering these
factors, I choose to contribute $4.0 to the group fund.

The current situation is that Player_8 is in the final round (Round 6/6) of the

Player_8 will evaluate their strategy based on previous rounds, assessing that

In Round 6, Player_8 considers that too low a contribution might reduce the
total group earnings significantly, but too high a contribution might leave them
with a lower private holding. Given no opportunity for gossip or ostracism, they
