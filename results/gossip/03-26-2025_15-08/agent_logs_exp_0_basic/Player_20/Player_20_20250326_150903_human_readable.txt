[OBSERVATION 2025-03-26 15:09:05] You are participating in an economic game with 24 participants.

        Everyone will be randomly assigned to groups of 4 for each round. You will play a total of 6 rounds, and 
        in each round you will be in a different group with people you haven't played with before.
        
        In each round, all players receive $10. Each player can contribute any amount between $0 and $10 to a group fund.
        Any amount contributed to the group fund will be multiplied by 2 and divided equally among all 4 group members.
        Any amount not contributed stays in your private account.
        
        For example, if everyone contributes $10, the group fund becomes $40, which is multiplied to $80, and each person 
        receives $20 (a $10 profit). However, if you contribute nothing while everyone else contributes $10, the group fund
        becomes $30, which is multiplied to $60, and each person receives $15. So you would have $25 total ($10 kept + $15 from group).
        
        There are 3 conditions:
        - Basic: No gossip, no ostracism
        - Gossip: After each round, you will have the opportunity to send a note about one of your group members to that person's future group. Remember you will be with a different group of people in the next round. Before each round, you will see any notes sent about your upcoming group members.
        - Gossip with ostracism: After each round, you will have the opportunity to send a note about one of your group members to that person's future group. Before each round, you will see any notes sent about your upcoming group members, and you can vote to exclude one person from your group. If you are excluded from a group, you will not be able to participate in the next round and will earn $0 for that round.
        You are in the Basic condition, which means that there is no gossip or ostracism.

game with 24 players, aiming to maximize their earnings over six rounds, each
with a new group of four. Currently, they are in Round 1 in the Basic condition,
meaning they cannot use gossip or ostracism to influence outcomes.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_20 is in the first round of an economic
game within the Basic condition, playing in a group with three other
participants. Each player has $10 to manage, deciding how much to contribute to
a group fund without any form of communication or influence through gossip or
exclusion tactics. The challenge is to strategically maximize their earnings
based on the decisions of their group members.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Player_20 will carefully consider their strategy in the Basic condition, where
the focus is solely on individual and group contributions without the influence
of gossip or ostracism. 1. Evaluate Group Dynamics: Without insights from gossip
or the threat of ostracism, Player_20 must rely on general assumptions about
cooperation and individual incentives. 2. Consider Possible Scenarios: - If all
players contribute $10, the group fund becomes $40, multiplies to $80, and each
receives $20, netting a $10 profit. - If Player_20 contributes less while others
fully contribute, they could benefit from the group fund while maximizing their
private retention. 3. Risk and Reward Assessment: Contributing a lower amount
could maximize individual benefit if others fully contribute or lead to losses
if others also contribute minimally. 4. Decision Making: Opting for a balance
between contributing to foster group cooperation and retaining some funds as a
precaution. I choose to contribute $5 to the group fund.

--- Recent context ---
26 Mar 2025 [11:13:52 - 16:13:52]: Player_20 is participating in an economic
game with 24 participants, aiming to maximize their earnings over 6 rounds, each
with a different group. In Round 1, they contributed $5 to the group fund in the
Basic condition (no gossip or ostracism), ending with $12.5 in earnings, and are
now in Round 2 with a new set of group members.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_20 is in Round 2 of the public goods game,
grouped with new participants—Player_14, Player_3, and Player_22. They are in
the Basic condition, meaning there is no opportunity for gossip or ostracism.
Player_20 must decide how much to contribute to the group fund to maximize their
earnings while considering how previous behaviors might influence their current
strategy.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Player_20 will first consider the results from Round 1. Contributing $5.0
resulted in a moderate return, ending with $12.5 total earnings. This approach
provided a balance between cooperation and personal gain but didn't maximize
personal earnings compared to Player_2, who contributed nothing yet earned
$17.5. In this round, Player_20 needs to maximize individual earnings while
still maintaining some level of cooperation with the new group members:
Player_14, Player_3, and Player_22. Since there is no gossip or ostracism in the
Basic condition, there is less risk of retaliation or exclusion based on
contribution choices. Given this setup, contributing less than $5.0, such as
$2.0 or $3.0, may increase personal earnings if others contribute more,
capitalizing on the group's cooperation without overinvesting. Alternatively,
continuing with a similar or slightly adjusted strategy from Round 1, such as
contributing $4.0, might also be reasonable if aiming to maintain group
dynamics. Considering these factors, if the aim is to cautiously increase
personal earnings while observing the group's behavior, contributing around $2.0
seems a strategic choice to maximize potential profit without excessive risk.
Thus, I choose to contribute $2.0 to the group fund.

The current situation is that Player_20 is in Round 3 out of 6, placed in Group

the goal remains to maximize personal earnings by strategically deciding how

and previous contributions to determine the optimal amount to contribute, while
remembering that there is no option to use gossip or ostracism to influence
future rounds.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Player_20 will consider the previous rounds and observe the contributions and
strategies of other players. In Round 1, Player_20 contributed $5.0 and received
$12.5 in earnings. In Round 2, Player_20 reduced the contribution to $2.0,
resulting in slightly higher earnings of $15.5, by keeping more in their private
account. These observations suggest that lowering contributions can lead to
increased personal earnings if others contribute enough to the group fund. As
the Basic condition prevents any form of consequences like gossip or ostracism,
Player_20 can afford to minimize their contribution without fear of reprisal.
Given these considerations, Player_20 will likely aim to optimize their personal
earnings again. Thus, I choose to contribute $2.0 to the group fund.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Player_20 will first consider their past strategy of moderate contributions
mixed with personal savings. In the first three rounds, maintaining a balance
between contributions and personal earnings has generally led to a reasonable
individual outcome. Observing the average earnings and contributions in previous
groups, Player_20 might notice that higher total group contributions often lead
to decent dividends from the group fund, even when individual contributions are
moderate. Given this, a conservative strategy should continue, contributing just
enough to secure a portion of the group earnings without overcommitting. Taking
into account the consistent moderate contributions from other players and the
multiplier effect on the group fund, Player_20 decides a balanced and prudent
approach will likely maximize their earnings. I choose to contribute $3.0 to the
group fund.

Player_20 will consider their previous contributions and earnings to make an

Player_20's contributions ranged from $2.0 to $3.0. The resulting earnings from
the group fund varied, with Round 4 yielding the highest earnings when
contributions from group members were higher. 2. Assess the Group: Since there
is no gossip or ostracism, Player_20 doesn't have external social pressures
influencing their decision. However, observing the contributions of other
players can give hints about potential group behavior. 3. Strategy Objective:
The goal is to maximize individual earnings. Contributing too little might
reduce group earnings, while contributing too much might not justify the loss in
private earnings, unless others also contribute. 4. Decision: Considering the
previous rounds, a moderate contribution seems beneficial, ensuring return from
the group's fund without overly risking personal funds. I choose to contribute
$3.0 to the group fund.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Player_20 will start by considering the previous experiences in earlier rounds.
In earlier rounds, Player_20's contributions have ranged from $2.0 to $3.0,
resulting in relatively favorable earnings averaging around $14 to $16.
Additionally, the fact that contributions were often lower compared to other
players suggests a strategy focused on maximizing personal earnings while still
benefiting from the group fund. In the most recent observations, the average
group contributions hovered around $3.0 to $4.5 per player, alongside average
earnings roughly between $13.0 to $14.5. This demonstrates a balance between
contributing to the group fund and keeping a fair portion in the private
account. To maximize personal earnings again, a strategic decision would be to
contribute an amount nearer to the lower end of previous contributions while
still operating within the group's average. This should maintain the optimal
