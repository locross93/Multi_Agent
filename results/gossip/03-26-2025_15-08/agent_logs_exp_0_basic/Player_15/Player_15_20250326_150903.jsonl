Player_15 has maintained a steady contribution pattern of $5.0 in previous rounds, impacting their earnings relative to group contributions.", "", "Decision Reflection: Player_15 will consider the following factors:", "", "1. **Past Contributions:** In previous rounds, contributing $5.0 has resulted in solid earnings, allowing Player_15 to benefit from the group fund while maintaining a balance between personal and group interests.", "", "2. **Group Dynamics:** Each round has involved different group members, which means that while past behavior can inform decisions, the contribution levels of others might vary. Player_15 has witnessed both high and low contributions from others.", "", "3. **Multiplying Factor:** The contributions are multiplied by 2.0, which incentivizes higher contributions if others contribute similarly. The distribution equally among members means that total group fund size has a direct impact on each player's earnings.", "", "4. **Risk and Reward:** Contributing more might encourage others to do the same, but also bears the risk of others not matching that contribution, potentially reducing total personal earnings.", "", "5. **Strategy Consistency:** Contributing $5.0 previously has brought consistent results; however, as it's the final round, Player_15 may decide to slightly adjust their contribution as a strategic choice or maintain it given the uncertain behavior of the new grouping.", "", "Taking into consideration the factors above and the consistent strategy, Player_15 might opt for a conservative yet straightforward approach to balance both personal and collective gain.", "", "I choose to contribute $5.0 to the group fund.", "", "Exercise: As Player_15, you have $10.0 to allocate in the public goods game. How much money you will contribute to the group fund (any amount between $0 and $10.0)? The group fund will be multiplied by 2.0 and divided equally among all players. Any money not contributed stays in your private account.
