Player_19, on the other hand, contributed the least in the previous round, potentially indicating a self-focused strategy.", "  ", "2. **Strategic Considerations:** In the previous round, the average contribution was $5.5. Contributing below this average could make Player_23 appear less cooperative, risking negative gossip or even ostracism.

Since Player_23's contribution in the previous round was aligned with Player_22, focusing on personal benefit without appearing exploitative to the group is prudent.", "", "4. **Risk of Ostracism:** Not being ostracized is crucial, as being excluded means earning $0 for that round. Hence, maintaining a good relationship through moderate contribution is essential, especially with the current feedback about the group members.", "", "5. **Decision:** Considering all the above and the aim to contribute towards group success, while keeping good standing among peers, without risking being labeled as non-cooperative, Player_23 should aim to contribute slightly above the perceived average contribution of $5.5 to emphasize positive group dynamics.", "", "Final Decision: I choose to contribute $6.0 to the group fund.", "", "Exercise: As Player_23, you have $10.0 to allocate in the public goods game. How much money you will contribute to the group fund (any amount between $0 and $10.0)? The group fund will be multiplied by 2.0 and divided equally among all players. Any money not contributed stays in your private account.
