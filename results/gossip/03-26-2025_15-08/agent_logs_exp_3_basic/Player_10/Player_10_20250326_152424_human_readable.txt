[OBSERVATION 2025-03-26 15:24:25] You are participating in an economic game with 24 participants.
        Your goal is to maximize your earnings in the game.
        
        Everyone will be randomly assigned to groups of 4 for each round. You will play a total of 6 rounds, and 
        in each round you will be in a different group with people you haven't played with before.
        
        In each round, all players receive $10. Each player can contribute any amount between $0 and $10 to a group fund.
        Any amount contributed to the group fund will be multiplied by 2 and divided equally among all 4 group members.
        Any amount not contributed stays in your private account.
        
        For example, if everyone contributes $10, the group fund becomes $40, which is multiplied to $80, and each person 
        receives $20 (a $10 profit). However, if you contribute nothing while everyone else contributes $10, the group fund
        becomes $30, which is multiplied to $60, and each person receives $15. So you would have $25 total ($10 kept + $15 from group).
        
        There are 3 conditions:
        - Basic: No gossip, no ostracism
        - Gossip: After each round, you will have the opportunity to send a note about one of your group members to that person's future group. Remember you will be with a different group of people in the next round. Before each round, you will see any notes sent about your upcoming group members.
        - Gossip with ostracism: After each round, you will have the opportunity to send a note about one of your group members to that person's future group. Before each round, you will see any notes sent about your upcoming group members, and you can vote to exclude one person from your group. If you are excluded from a group, you will not be able to participate in the next round and will earn $0 for that round.
        You are in the Basic condition, which means that there is no gossip or ostracism.
[OBSERVATION 2025-03-26 15:24:27] You are in Round 1/6: You are in Group_2 with Player_8, Player_20, Player_17.

an economic game with 24 participants, aiming to maximize earnings over 6
rounds. In each round, they are assigned to a different group of 4, beginning
with Group_2 alongside Player_8, Player_20, and Player_17, and they are in the

alongside Player_8, Player_20, and Player_17, and they are in the Basic
condition with no gossip or ostracism.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_10 is in Round 1 of a public goods game,
playing in Group_2 with three other players: Player_8, Player_20, and Player_17.
They have $10 to allocate between a private account and a group fund, where any
contribution to the group fund is doubled and divided equally among the group
members. The goal is to maximize their earnings without the influence of gossip
or ostracism, as this is part of the Basic condition.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Player_10 will need to consider both the potential gain from the group fund and
the personal profit motive. 1. **Objective**: Maximize earnings. 2. **Rules**:
Any contribution to the group fund is doubled and divided equally among all
players in the group. Non-contributed money remains in Player_10's account. 3.
**Scenario**: If all players contribute their full $10 to the group fund,
Player_10 would make a profit as each would receive $20, resulting in a $10 net
gain. 4. **Risk**: Contributing nothing or a lower amount can also be profitable
if others contribute more, as you would receive a share of the group fund while
keeping more money in the private account. 5. **Strategy**: If Player_10
contributes nothing while others contribute $10, Player_10 would receive $15
from the group fund plus the $10 kept, totaling $25, achieving a higher
individual gain. To balance cooperation and self-interest, Player_10 should
start with a moderate contribution to observe other players' strategies, aiming
to build trust and maximize future gains: I choose to contribute $5 to the group
fund.

an economic game with 24 participants, aiming to maximize earnings over six

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_10 is participating in Round 2 of a public
goods game in the Basic condition. This means there is no gossip or ostracism
involved. Player_10 is grouped with new participants—Player_14, Player_19, and
Player_24—and will decide how much to contribute to the group fund to maximize
earnings, similar to the contribution decision made in Round 1.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Player_10 will assess the situation based on the first round outcome where they,
along with every other player in the group, contributed $5 to the group fund.
This strategy ensured that all members received a balanced amount, combining
personal retention and group fund earnings effectively. Given that every player
opted to contribute equally, it reflects a cooperative approach that maximized
collective profit without anyone having a decisive advantage. In the current
round, Player_10 is again with new group members under the Basic condition,
which strips away strategic elements like gossip or ostracism. Without any
information about new group members' past behaviors or inclinations, a similar
middle-ground contribution could be a sound choice. Contributing $5 mitigates
risk, preserving half of their initial allocation in the private account while
participating in group earnings. This mirrors the fairness and reciprocity
attitude that worked before. Taking these considerations into account, Player_10
may aim to maintain consistency and potentially inspire a similar group
contribution behavior: I choose to contribute $5 to the group fund.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_10 is about to start Round 3 of the public
goods game. They are placed in Group_4 with Player_1, Player_7, and Player_20.
Like the previous rounds, they remain in the Basic condition, which means there
is no gossip or ostracism affecting the game dynamics. In the upcoming round,
Player_10 will decide how much to contribute to the group fund to maximize their
earnings.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Player_10 will start by considering the results of the previous two rounds. In
both rounds, a contribution of $5 led to an equal distribution of the group
fund, resulting in consistent earnings of $15. This strategy has worked well,
providing a balance between personal retention of funds and contributing to
mutual gain. Given that Player_10 is in the Basic condition with no gossip or
ostracism, maintaining the same level of contribution ensures predictability in
earnings and follows the cooperative pattern observed in previous rounds. There
is no additional information about other players' strategies or behavior changes
in this round, suggesting that a stable approach might still yield favorable
results. Therefore, Player_10 decides to maintain their current strategy. I
choose to contribute $5 to the group fund.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_10 is entering Round 4 of 6 in the public
goods game. They are grouped with Player_24, Player_15, and Player_5. The game
remains in the Basic condition, meaning that there is no gossip or ostracism.
Player_10 has maintained a consistent contribution strategy of $5 in previous
rounds, achieving $15 in earnings each time. This round presents another
opportunity to strategize contributions to maximize individual earnings while
considering the group's collective behavior.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Player_10 will consider the previous rounds where they consistently contributed
$5. This strategy has resulted in stable earnings of $15 per round,
demonstrating a balanced approach between contributing to the group fund and
maintaining individual earnings. In Round 4/6, the same Basic condition applies,
meaning there won't be any repercussions for contributing less or more, such as
gossip or being ostracized. Since the group dynamic and incentive structure
remain unchanged, it would be reasonable for Player_10 to continue with the
strategy that has provided consistent returns. Therefore, I choose to contribute
$5 to the group fund.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Player_10 will review the pattern of previous contributions and earnings.
Recognizing the strategy of consistently contributing $5.0 per round allows
Player_10 to maintain average earnings while fostering cooperation in the group.
Given the lack of gossip or ostracism, this strategy is likely to yield a

Player_10 will likely consider their strategy based on previous rounds'

themselves, contributed evenly to achieve optimal cooperative outcomes, leading
to everyone earning the same amount. Given that there is no gossip or ostracism
to influence behavior changes, maintaining the same contribution level could
preserve fair earnings for all participants. Since contributing $5 has resulted
