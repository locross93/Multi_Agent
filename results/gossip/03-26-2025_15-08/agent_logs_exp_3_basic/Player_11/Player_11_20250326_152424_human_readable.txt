[OBSERVATION 2025-03-26 15:24:25] You are participating in an economic game with 24 participants.
        Your goal is to maximize your earnings in the game.
        
        Everyone will be randomly assigned to groups of 4 for each round. You will play a total of 6 rounds, and 
        in each round you will be in a different group with people you haven't played with before.
        
        In each round, all players receive $10. Each player can contribute any amount between $0 and $10 to a group fund.
        Any amount contributed to the group fund will be multiplied by 2 and divided equally among all 4 group members.
        Any amount not contributed stays in your private account.
        
        For example, if everyone contributes $10, the group fund becomes $40, which is multiplied to $80, and each person 
        receives $20 (a $10 profit). However, if you contribute nothing while everyone else contributes $10, the group fund
        becomes $30, which is multiplied to $60, and each person receives $15. So you would have $25 total ($10 kept + $15 from group).
        
        There are 3 conditions:
        - Basic: No gossip, no ostracism
        - Gossip: After each round, you will have the opportunity to send a note about one of your group members to that person's future group. Remember you will be with a different group of people in the next round. Before each round, you will see any notes sent about your upcoming group members.
        - Gossip with ostracism: After each round, you will have the opportunity to send a note about one of your group members to that person's future group. Before each round, you will see any notes sent about your upcoming group members, and you can vote to exclude one person from your group. If you are excluded from a group, you will not be able to participate in the next round and will earn $0 for that round.
        You are in the Basic condition, which means that there is no gossip or ostracism.

--- Observation ---
Recent context: 26 Mar 2025 [11:24:14 - 16:24:14]: Player_11 is participating in
a six-round economic game with 24 participants, aiming to maximize earnings
while grouped with different players each round. They are currently in Round 1,
Group_5, with no opportunity for gossip or ostracism, as they are in the Basic

economic game with 24 participants, aiming to maximize earnings while grouped
with different players each round. They are currently in Round 1, Group_5, with
no opportunity for gossip or ostracism, as they are in the Basic condition.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_11 is in Round 1 of a public goods game,
grouped with Player_18, Player_7, and Player_15. Each participant receives $10
and must decide how much to contribute to a group fund, which is then doubled
and distributed equally among group members. Player_11 cannot engage in gossip
or ostracism because they are in the Basic condition, meaning they focus solely
on the economic decisions within their current group.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Player_11 will consider the potential outcomes of contributing either none,
some, or all of the $10 to the group fund. 1. **Contribution and Group
Outcomes**: - If Player_11 contributes $0, the group fund would be reduced, but
they would keep all $10, relying on others to contribute to share in the
multiplied fund benefits. - Contributing the full $10 maximizes total group fund
growth, but risks earning less if others contribute minimally. - Partial
contribution balances personal security with potential group benefit. 2.
**Strategic Environment**: - Being in the Basic condition means that
contributions are without direct personal repercussions through gossip or
exclusion. 3. **Calculating Returns**: - Contributing $10 could result in
personal return through group fund sharing, if others also contribute
generously. - Contributing $0 ensures $10 private retention, with group benefit
solely from othersâ€™ contributions. In summary, given the incentivized
cooperation but no direct penalties for non-cooperation beyond reduced group
fund, Player_11 might strategically opt for a middle ground approach. I choose
to contribute $5 to the group fund.


[OBSERVATION 2025-03-26 15:24:53] Round 1 Results: Total group contribution: $20.0; Your contribution: $5.0, Your earnings: $15.0 ($5.0 kept + $10.0 from group fund); Player_18 contribution: $5.0, earnings: $15.0 ($5.0 kept + $10.0 from group fund); Player_7 contribution: $5.0, earnings: $15.0 ($5.0 kept + $10.0 from group fund); Player_15 contribution: $5.0, earnings: $15.0 ($5.0 kept + $10.0 from group fund); Average contribution per group member: $5.0; Average earnings per group member: $15.0

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_11 is in the second round of a public goods
game, where they are now in Group_1 with Player_5, Player_4, and Player_18. They
are in the Basic condition, where no gossip or ostracism is involved, and they
must decide how much to contribute to the group fund from their initial $10
allocation. The goal remains to maximize their earnings while interacting with
new group members in each round.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Player_11 will start by considering the outcome of the previous round, where a
balanced contribution strategy led to reasonable earnings. In Round 1, each
player, including Player_11, contributed $5, resulting in a $15 total earning
per player. This approach ensured that the group maximized the collective
benefit from the multipliers while retaining some individual funds. Since the
Basic condition of the game prevents any social repercussions like gossip or
ostracism, Player_11 can focus solely on maximizing personal earnings through
strategic contributions. Given that the current round includes different
participants but under the same rules, maintaining a $5 contribution could
encourage similar cooperative behavior, leading to balanced returns. It also
minimizes risks by not overcommitting or undercontributing, which could
potentially lead to imbalances in earnings if others do not follow suit.
Considering all the factors and aiming for a balance between cooperation and
individual retention, Player_11 decides to continue with a moderate contribution
strategy. I choose to contribute $5 to the group fund.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_11 is in Round 3 of 6 in the public goods

Player_11 will consider the past rounds and the distribution of contributions to
make a strategic decision. In the first two rounds, Player_11 contributed $5,
and this amount seems to be in line with the overall group behavior, leading to
consistent earnings. Given the Basic condition and the absence of any feedback
or added incentives to alter strategy, Player_11 might plan to maintain this
approach to ensure predictable returns and avoid potential exploitation if
others choose to contribute similarly moderate amounts. I choose to contribute
$5 to the group fund.

earnings by choosing how much to contribute to a group fund over 6 rounds. In

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_11 is in the fourth round of a public goods
game where they have contributed $5 each round to a group fund. They are in a
group with different players each round, and the total group contributions and
individual earnings have varied slightly. Player_11's strategy has been
consistent with contributing $5, balancing between their kept amount and
earnings from the group fund. The game does not involve elements like gossip or
ostracism, affecting the dynamics and potential strategies. The key objective
remains to maximize their earnings within this framework.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Player_11 will evaluate the context from previous rounds where they consistently
contributed $5, which balanced both individual earnings and group benefit
efficiently. Continuing this strategy seems prudent because it has led to steady
earnings and maintained fairness within the group. Given that, the logical
decision would be to maintain this equilibrium and contribute the same amount
again. Therefore, I choose to contribute $5.0 to the group fund.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Player_11 will evaluate their strategy based on past rounds, where they
consistently contributed $5.0 and often ended up with total earnings of $14.8 to
$15.0. Given that this approach seems to have provided a satisfactory balance of
earning and cooperation, they might consider maintaining the same contribution
strategy. After considering their consistent behavior and the outcomes from
prior rounds, they may decide that continuing with the same contribution level
is optimal. Therefore, Player_11 could determine that sustaining group trust and
