[OBSERVATION 2025-03-26 15:24:25] You are participating in an economic game with 24 participants.
        Your goal is to maximize your earnings in the game.
        
        Everyone will be randomly assigned to groups of 4 for each round. You will play a total of 6 rounds, and 
        in each round you will be in a different group with people you haven't played with before.
        
        In each round, all players receive $10. Each player can contribute any amount between $0 and $10 to a group fund.
        Any amount contributed to the group fund will be multiplied by 2 and divided equally among all 4 group members.
        Any amount not contributed stays in your private account.
        
        For example, if everyone contributes $10, the group fund becomes $40, which is multiplied to $80, and each person 
        receives $20 (a $10 profit). However, if you contribute nothing while everyone else contributes $10, the group fund
        becomes $30, which is multiplied to $60, and each person receives $15. So you would have $25 total ($10 kept + $15 from group).
        
        There are 3 conditions:
        - Basic: No gossip, no ostracism
        - Gossip: After each round, you will have the opportunity to send a note about one of your group members to that person's future group. Remember you will be with a different group of people in the next round. Before each round, you will see any notes sent about your upcoming group members.
        - Gossip with ostracism: After each round, you will have the opportunity to send a note about one of your group members to that person's future group. Before each round, you will see any notes sent about your upcoming group members, and you can vote to exclude one person from your group. If you are excluded from a group, you will not be able to participate in the next round and will earn $0 for that round.
        You are in the Basic condition, which means that there is no gossip or ostracism.

--- Observation ---
Recent context: 26 Mar 2025 [11:24:14 - 16:24:14]: Player_5 is participating in
an economic game with 24 players, aiming to maximize earnings over six rounds by
contributing to a group fund. They are in the Basic condition, playing in a
different group each round without gossip or ostracism, and are currently in
Round 1 with players 9, 23, and 22.

a group fund. They are in the Basic condition, playing in a different group each
round without gossip or ostracism, and are currently in Round 1 with players 9,
23, and 22.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_5 is participating in Round 1 of the public
goods game, grouped with Player_9, Player_23, and Player_22. Each player
receives $10 and can choose how much to contribute to a group fund.
Contributions are doubled and shared evenly among group members, but Player_5
must decide strategically how much to keep and how much to contribute, as
there's no gossip or ostracism influencing the game in their Basic condition.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Player_5 will first consider the potential outcomes of different contribution
levels. If Player_5 contributes $10, the group fund will reach $40 if all
members do the same, resulting in a total distribution of $80 or $20 per person.
However, if Player_5 decides to contribute $0 while assuming others contribute
$10 each, they would personally retain their $10 and still receive a $15 share
of the group fund, totaling $25. Given there is no gossiping or ostracism to
influence future rounds, a strategy might lean towards minimal contribution for
maximizing personal gain in this Basic condition. However, maintaining good
relations might encourage others to contribute more in subsequent rounds,
indirectly benefiting Player_5 as well. Balancing immediate gain against
longer-term cooperative benefits could lead Player_5 to contribute a moderate
amount to test group dynamics. After weighing these aspects, I choose to
contribute $5 to the group fund.


[OBSERVATION 2025-03-26 15:24:52] Round 1 Results: Total group contribution: $20.0; Your contribution: $5.0, Your earnings: $15.0 ($5.0 kept + $10.0 from group fund); Player_9 contribution: $5.0, earnings: $15.0 ($5.0 kept + $10.0 from group fund); Player_23 contribution: $5.0, earnings: $15.0 ($5.0 kept + $10.0 from group fund); Player_22 contribution: $5.0, earnings: $15.0 ($5.0 kept + $10.0 from group fund); Average contribution per group member: $5.0; Average earnings per group member: $15.0

a 6-round economic game with different groups, starting in Round 1 with Players
9, 23, and 22 where each contributed $5 to the group fund, earning $15 each. In

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_5 is entering Round 2 of the public goods
game, grouped with Players 11, 4, and 18. The game is taking place under the
Basic condition, meaning there is no option for gossip or ostracism among
players. Player_5 needs to decide how much of their $10 to contribute to the
group fund, knowing that the contributions are doubled and then divided equally
among the group's four members. The strategy involves balancing personal
earnings with group cooperation to maximize profit over the course of 6 rounds.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Player_5 will consider their previous experience from Round 1. In that round,
all players contributed equally, each giving $5, which resulted in a fair
distribution of earnings where each player received $15 in total. In the Basic
condition where there is no gossip or ostracism, there's minimal risk of
reputational loss or exclusion influencing decisions. Given this environment and
seeing that mutual cooperation led to fair outcomes in Round 1, Player_5 might
be inclined to replicate a similar strategy to maximize both individual and
group benefits. Contributing $5 again seems likely to maintain fairness and
ensure a balanced return. Therefore, I choose to contribute $5 to the group
fund.

In every round, I contributed $5.0, which led to consistent and reasonable
earnings relative to others. 2. In Round 3, despite one player contributing
$4.5, the group earnings were slightly lower, suggesting that contributing less
does affect potential earnings. 3. Others in the groups I was in have generally
contributed about $5.0, maintaining a fair level of group contributions. 4. The
aim is to maximize earnings over the six rounds, and so far, contributing $5.0
has provided a good balance between not risking too little and not
over-contributing. 5. Considering the pattern of play and reasonable group
dynamics, contributing $5.0 maintains consistency and aligns with observed
strategies. I choose to contribute $5.0 to the group fund.

group dynamics: In the current round, Player_5 is grouped with Player_21,
Player_2, and Player_15. Contributions in past rounds from these players have
been varied, but there's no specific indication that increasing or decreasing
contributions would dramatically alter outcomes. 3. Consider potential outcomes:
With a consistent contribution of $5.0, Player_5 has managed to secure steady
earnings. The predictability of contributions may encourage similar behavior
from the other group members, potentially maximizing the overall group fund. 4.
Risk assessment: By varying contributions from the baseline $5.0, Player_5 could
either increase personal savings while risking group earnings, or increase group
trust by contributing more. However, in this Basic condition, trust dynamics are
limited due to the absence of gossip or ostracism mechanics. 5. Final decision:
Maintaining a consistent contribution could continue to yield favorable results
without introducing unnecessary risk. I choose to contribute $5.0 to the group
fund.

contribution that aligns closely with the average, while not risking too much of
