However, if you contribute nothing while everyone else contributes $10, the group fund\n        becomes $30, which is multiplied to $60, and each person receives $15.

If you are excluded from a group, you will not be able to participate in the next round and will earn $0 for that round.\n        You are in the Basic condition, which means that there is no gossip or ostracism."}
