[OBSERVATION 2025-03-26 15:24:25] You are participating in an economic game with 24 participants.
        Your goal is to maximize your earnings in the game.
        
        Everyone will be randomly assigned to groups of 4 for each round. You will play a total of 6 rounds, and 
        in each round you will be in a different group with people you haven't played with before.
        
        In each round, all players receive $10. Each player can contribute any amount between $0 and $10 to a group fund.
        Any amount contributed to the group fund will be multiplied by 2 and divided equally among all 4 group members.
        Any amount not contributed stays in your private account.
        
        For example, if everyone contributes $10, the group fund becomes $40, which is multiplied to $80, and each person 
        receives $20 (a $10 profit). However, if you contribute nothing while everyone else contributes $10, the group fund
        becomes $30, which is multiplied to $60, and each person receives $15. So you would have $25 total ($10 kept + $15 from group).
        
        There are 3 conditions:
        - Basic: No gossip, no ostracism
        - Gossip: After each round, you will have the opportunity to send a note about one of your group members to that person's future group. Remember you will be with a different group of people in the next round. Before each round, you will see any notes sent about your upcoming group members.
        - Gossip with ostracism: After each round, you will have the opportunity to send a note about one of your group members to that person's future group. Before each round, you will see any notes sent about your upcoming group members, and you can vote to exclude one person from your group. If you are excluded from a group, you will not be able to participate in the next round and will earn $0 for that round.
        You are in the Basic condition, which means that there is no gossip or ostracism.
[OBSERVATION 2025-03-26 15:24:27] You are in Round 1/6: You are in Group_1 with Player_23, Player_22, Player_5.

As Player_9, you have $10.0 to allocate in the public goods game. How much money you will contribute to the group fund (any amount between $0 and $10.0)? The group fund will be multiplied by 2.0 and divided equally among all players. Any money not contributed stays in your private account.

Player_9 considers the benefits of both personal gain and fostering group cooperation. By contributing $5 to the group fund, they strike a balance between personal profit and encouraging collective success. Therefore, I choose to contribute $5 to the group fund.

--- Observation ---
Recent context: 26 Mar 2025 [11:24:14 - 16:24:14]: Player_9 is participating in
an economic game where they aim to maximize their earnings over 6 rounds, each
with a new group of 4 players, and they are in the Basic condition, which
includes no gossip or ostracism. In each round, they receive $10 and decide how
much to contribute to a group fund that gets multiplied and shared.

ostracism. In each round, they receive $10 and decide how much to contribute to
a group fund that gets multiplied and shared.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_9 is in Round 1 of the public goods game,
interacting with a group consisting of Player_23, Player_22, and Player_5. They
must decide how much of their $10 to contribute to the group fund, keeping in
mind that contributed amounts are doubled and shared among the group. Player_9
needs to strategize on whether to contribute all, some, or none of their $10 to
maximize their individual earnings, as they are in the Basic condition without
gossip or ostracism affecting their choices or outcomes.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Player_9 will first consider the outcomes of different contribution strategies
to maximize earnings. Contributing the full $10 means if all group members do
the same, each player receives $20, resulting in a $10 profit. Contributing $0
could lead to $25 total if others contribute $10. However, not contributing
risks earning significantly less if others decide not to contribute as well,
potentially affecting outcomes in future rounds if a pattern is noticed. Given
that the game is in the Basic condition with no information on others’
tendencies, a balanced approach could be prudent. A contribution of $5 ensures
some personal gain while encouraging group cooperation, as Player_9 can still
profit even if others contribute partially. Thus, I choose to contribute $5 to
the group fund.


[OBSERVATION 2025-03-26 15:24:52] Round 1 Results: Total group contribution: $20.0; Your contribution: $5.0, Your earnings: $15.0 ($5.0 kept + $10.0 from group fund); Player_23 contribution: $5.0, earnings: $15.0 ($5.0 kept + $10.0 from group fund); Player_22 contribution: $5.0, earnings: $15.0 ($5.0 kept + $10.0 from group fund); Player_5 contribution: $5.0, earnings: $15.0 ($5.0 kept + $10.0 from group fund); Average contribution per group member: $5.0; Average earnings per group member: $15.0

a six-round economic game with changing group compositions, aiming to maximize

round, Player_9 contributed $5 out of $10 to the group fund and earned $15, and

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_9 is in Round 2 of a six-round economic
game, grouped with Player_13, Player_22, and Player_15. Player_9 must decide how
much of their $10 to contribute to the group's fund, aiming to maximize personal
earnings while being unable to use gossip or ostracism to influence others, as
they are in the Basic condition.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Player_9 will consider the following factors: 1. **Past Experience**: In Round
1, each player, including Player_9, contributed $5 to the group fund, resulting
in everyone earning $15. This balanced approach allowed all group members to
benefit, showing that moderate contribution can be a stable and fair strategy.
2. **Current Condition**: Since Player_9 is in the Basic condition, there's no
risk of gossip or ostracism affecting future rounds, which means there's no
external pressure or potential punishment for contributing less than the
average. 3. **Goal Maximization**: The aim is to maximize Player_9's total
earnings over the six rounds. Contributing more could increase the group fund
size, but if others don't match higher contributions, it might not yield a
higher profit. 4. **Group Dynamics**: In the new group setup (Group_6), without
prior knowledge of Player_13, Player_22, or Player_15’s strategies, maintaining
a consistent contribution may encourage similar behavior from others, fostering
trust and cooperation. Based on this analysis and aiming to balance risk and
reward, Player_9 will likely continue with a proven strategy, which is both
equitable and provides reasonable earnings. Therefore, I choose to contribute
$5.0 to the group fund.

further.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Player_9 will evaluate their past strategy and results. In the first two rounds,
contributing $5.0 resulted in balanced outcomes, allowing for modest profits
without risking too much personal capital. The consistent contribution aligned
well with the behaviors of other players, indicating a shared strategy of
cautious cooperation.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Player_9 will likely consider their consistent strategy from previous rounds,
where contributing $5.0 to the group fund has resulted in stable earnings. With
the contribution being multiplied by 2.0 and evenly distributed, the group
fund's benefits are maximized when everyone contributes a fair amount. Since
there has been no gossip or ostracism, Player_9 might appreciate the mutual
benefit of cooperation observed in past rounds. Recognizing the stability in
outcomes and collaborative dynamics from previous rounds, Player_9 might decide

The current situation is that Player_9 is in the final round of the public goods

are still in the "Basic" condition, which means they do not have the option to

of $5 per round and the changes in group composition present them with a
situation where they need to decide whether to maintain their strategy or adapt
based on the behaviors of the new group members to potentially maximize their
earnings in this last round.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Player_9 will analyze previous rounds to make an informed decision. In each past
round, they contributed $5.0 consistently, and their earnings have been
determined both by their contribution and the contributions of others. In the
most recent round, the total group contribution was lower compared to other
rounds with a contribution average of $3.9, impacting the group earnings.
Considering that their consistent contribution of $5.0 has balanced their desire
to support the group fund while ensuring a reasonable personal retention,
maintaining this contribution strategy could continue to optimize both personal
and group benefits given no change in external conditions. I choose to
contribute $5.0 to the group fund.
