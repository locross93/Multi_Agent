[OBSERVATION 2025-03-26 15:24:25] You are participating in an economic game with 24 participants.
        Your goal is to maximize your earnings in the game.
        
        Everyone will be randomly assigned to groups of 4 for each round. You will play a total of 6 rounds, and 
        in each round you will be in a different group with people you haven't played with before.
        
        In each round, all players receive $10. Each player can contribute any amount between $0 and $10 to a group fund.
        Any amount contributed to the group fund will be multiplied by 2 and divided equally among all 4 group members.
        Any amount not contributed stays in your private account.
        
        For example, if everyone contributes $10, the group fund becomes $40, which is multiplied to $80, and each person 
        receives $20 (a $10 profit). However, if you contribute nothing while everyone else contributes $10, the group fund
        becomes $30, which is multiplied to $60, and each person receives $15. So you would have $25 total ($10 kept + $15 from group).
        
        There are 3 conditions:
        - Basic: No gossip, no ostracism
        - Gossip: After each round, you will have the opportunity to send a note about one of your group members to that person's future group. Remember you will be with a different group of people in the next round. Before each round, you will see any notes sent about your upcoming group members.
        - Gossip with ostracism: After each round, you will have the opportunity to send a note about one of your group members to that person's future group. Before each round, you will see any notes sent about your upcoming group members, and you can vote to exclude one person from your group. If you are excluded from a group, you will not be able to participate in the next round and will earn $0 for that round.
        You are in the Basic condition, which means that there is no gossip or ostracism.

Recent context: 26 Mar 2025 [11:24:14 - 16:24:14]: Player_13 is participating in
a six-round economic game with 24 players, where they are assigned to groups of
four and aim to maximize their earnings by deciding how much to contribute to a
group fund, which is doubled and shared among members. Player_13 is in the Basic
condition, meaning there is no gossip or ostracism allowed throughout the game.

to maximize their earnings by deciding how much to contribute to a group fund,
which is doubled and shared among members. Player_13 is in the Basic condition,
meaning there is no gossip or ostracism allowed throughout the game.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_13 is participating in the first round of a
six-round public goods game where they are in Group_3 with Player_24, Player_12,
and Player_2. In this round, Player_13 needs to decide how much of their $10
initial amount to contribute to the group fund. Contributions to the fund will
be doubled and then divided equally among all group members. Being in the Basic
condition, Player_13's decisions and outcomes from the game are not influenced
by gossip or the possibility of being ostracized.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Player_13 will first consider the potential outcomes of different contribution
amounts. If Player_13 contributes the entire $10, and all group members do the
same, everyone receives $20, resulting in a net gain of $10. However,
contributing less increases Player_13â€™s private balance while still benefiting
from the group fund contributions of others. Contributing nothing, while others
contribute $10, means Player_13 keeps $10 and receives an additional $15,
totaling $25. Balancing personal gain with contributing to group success is key.
Without the threat of gossip or ostracism, the decision weighs personal profit
versus cooperation. Therefore, I choose to contribute $5 to the group fund,
allowing for both personal benefit and group contribution.


[OBSERVATION 2025-03-26 15:24:52] Round 1 Results: Total group contribution: $13.0; Your contribution: $5.0, Your earnings: $11.5 ($5.0 kept + $6.5 from group fund); Player_24 contribution: $5.0, earnings: $11.5 ($5.0 kept + $6.5 from group fund); Player_12 contribution: $0.0, earnings: $16.5 ($10.0 kept + $6.5 from group fund); Player_2 contribution: $3.0, earnings: $13.5 ($7.0 kept + $6.5 from group fund); Average contribution per group member: $3.2; Average earnings per group member: $13.2

Recent context: 26 Mar 2025 [11:34:14 - 16:34:14]: Player_13 is participating in

economic game with 24 players, assigned to new groups of four each round without
gossip or ostracism. In Round 1, they contributed $5 to the group fund and

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_13 has entered Round 2 of the economic game
and is now grouped with Player_22, Player_15, and Player_9. In this basic
condition, Player_13 must decide on their contribution to the group fund without
any influence from gossip or ostracism mechanisms. Having contributed $5 in
Round 1 and observed others' contributions and earnings, Player_13 needs to
determine their strategy for maximizing earnings in this new group setup.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Player_13 will first consider the outcomes from Round 1, where contributing $5
resulted in a modest profit. The average group member contribution was $3.2,
indicating that not all players are maximizing the group's total potential by
contributing the full $10. If Player_13 contributes the full $10 in this round,
and others continue to contribute less, Player_13 could risk earning less
overall compared to contributing a smaller amount. However, if Player_13
contributes too little, and others choose to contribute more, they might miss
out on greater collective gains. Since this is the Basic condition, there's no
penalty for lower contributions such as gossip or ostracism. Evaluating these
factors strategically, Player_13 may decide that contributing slightly above the
previous average could encourage others to contribute more while still offering
a chance to maximize individual earnings, given that contributions get doubled
and redistributed. I choose to contribute $4.5 to the group fund.

Basic condition, meaning gossip or ostracism is not a factor, and the challenge
remains to decide how much to contribute to the group fund while aiming to
maximize their earnings.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Player_13 will need to weigh potential outcomes to decide on the optimal
contribution. 1. **Observing Previous Rounds:** - Round 1: A total group
contribution of $13 resulted in actual earnings slightly above the initial $10.
Contributing moderately didn't lead to significant gains. - Round 2: A higher
group contribution of $19.5 resulted in greater overall earnings due to better
group cooperation. 2. **Strategic Considerations:** - Contributing too little
may harm group trust and potential earnings. - Contributing too much without
reciprocal actions may reduce individual profit. 3. **Expectation of Group
Behavior:** - Based on earlier observations, groups with at least moderate
contributions (around $5) collectively performed better. - Expect members like
Player_2 and Player_9, observed in earlier rounds, to potentially contribute
around $4-$5. 4. **Risk vs Reward:** - Aim for a balanced approach that
maximizes earnings without taking undue financial risks. 5. **Decision:** - With
the goal of maximizing both personal and group earnings while accounting for
unpredictability, Player_13 should contribute a moderate amount: I choose to
contribute $4.5 to the group fund.

in group contributions and earnings.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_13 is in Round 4 of a six-round public
goods game. They are in Group_1 with Player_18, Player_9, and Player_11. As part
of the game's Basic condition, there is no gossip or ostracism, which means all
players make their contributions without the influence of such social dynamics.
Player_13 has demonstrated a strategy that involves varying their contributions,
having contributed $5.0 and $4.5 in previous rounds, while aiming to balance
their own earnings with total group contributions. The challenge continues to be
maximizing personal earnings while considering the cooperative aspect of the
game.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Player_13 will first consider the group composition and the trends in the
previous rounds. In Round 1, I contributed significantly but saw another member
contribute nothing, resulting in my earnings being below average. In Rounds 2
and 3, I contributed slightly less than my peers but ended with above-average
earnings as the group collectively increased contributions, resulting in higher
group fund returns. In Round 4, considering my consistent strategy of
contributing moderately while maintaining competitive earnings, I will aim to
balance personal income and group benefit. Since my contributions in the
previous two rounds have been $4.5, which aligned well with the group's average,
I will likely continue with this strategy, especially given the new group
dynamics. Therefore, I choose to contribute $4.5 to the group fund.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Player_13 will first consider their previous strategy of contributing
approximately $4.5, which has been consistent across earlier rounds. This
contribution strategy allowed them to maintain a balance between personal
earnings and benefiting from the group fund. Observing that contributing around
$4.5 has resulted in competitive earnings compared to other players while
avoiding exposure to free-riding behavior, it might be prudent to continue with
a similar contribution in the final round. Given the group dynamics observed in
previous rounds and the impact on average earnings, a continuation of this
strategy seems reasonable. Thus, they might decide to maintain consistency with
their past contributions to achieve a favorable outcome. I choose to contribute
$4.5 to the group fund.
