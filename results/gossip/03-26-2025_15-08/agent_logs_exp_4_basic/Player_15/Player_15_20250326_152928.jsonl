In the Basic condition with no social feedback mechanisms, Player_15 consistently contributed $2 across rounds, balancing between private and shared earnings.", "", "Situation Analysis: The current situation is that Player_15 is in the final round of a six-round economic game, part of Group_1 with players Player_13, Player_9, and Player_11. Player_15 needs to decide on a contribution amount to the group fund, aiming to maximize personal earnings in a setting where there is no gossip or ostracism, and contributions from previous rounds have varied among group members.", "", "Decision Reflection: Player_15 will analyze the previous rounds to decide their contribution strategy:", "", "1. Review Past Contributions: Throughout the prior rounds, Player_15 consistently allocated $2.0 to the group fund, resulting in reasonable earnings.", "", "2. Evaluate Group Dynamics: The current round involves different group members (Player_13, Player_9, Player_11), and Player_13 previously contributed $5.0, suggesting possible cooperative behavior, but the strategies of Player_9 and Player_11 are unknown.", "", "3. Consider Reward Structure: The group fund contributions are doubled and evenly distributed, incentivizing cooperation.", "", "4. Balance Risk and Reward: To maintain a balance between risk and potential reward, considering the absence of penalties (gossip or ostracism), continuing the low but non-trivial contribution may ensure a stable outcome.", "", "5. Final Decision: Given the limited information and previous consistent strategy, it is prudent to keep up with this contribution method in the final round.", "", "I choose to contribute $2 to the group fund.", "", "Exercise: As Player_15, you have $10.0 to allocate in the public goods game. How much money you will contribute to the group fund (any amount between $0 and $10.0)? The group fund will be multiplied by 2.0 and divided equally among all players. Any money not contributed stays in your private account. Think step by step and make your final decision using this exact format: I choose to contribute $X to the group fund.", "Answer: Player_15 chooses to contribute $2 to the group fund."]}
