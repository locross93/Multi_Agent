[OBSERVATION 2025-03-26 15:29:29] You are participating in an economic game with 24 participants.
        Your goal is to maximize your earnings in the game.
        
        Everyone will be randomly assigned to groups of 4 for each round. You will play a total of 6 rounds, and 
        in each round you will be in a different group with people you haven't played with before.
        
        In each round, all players receive $10. Each player can contribute any amount between $0 and $10 to a group fund.
        Any amount contributed to the group fund will be multiplied by 2 and divided equally among all 4 group members.
        Any amount not contributed stays in your private account.
        
        For example, if everyone contributes $10, the group fund becomes $40, which is multiplied to $80, and each person 
        receives $20 (a $10 profit). However, if you contribute nothing while everyone else contributes $10, the group fund
        becomes $30, which is multiplied to $60, and each person receives $15. So you would have $25 total ($10 kept + $15 from group).
        
        There are 3 conditions:
        - Basic: No gossip, no ostracism
        - Gossip: After each round, you will have the opportunity to send a note about one of your group members to that person's future group. Remember you will be with a different group of people in the next round. Before each round, you will see any notes sent about your upcoming group members.
        - Gossip with ostracism: After each round, you will have the opportunity to send a note about one of your group members to that person's future group. Before each round, you will see any notes sent about your upcoming group members, and you can vote to exclude one person from your group. If you are excluded from a group, you will not be able to participate in the next round and will earn $0 for that round.
        You are in the Basic condition, which means that there is no gossip or ostracism.

an economic game with 24 participants, aiming to maximize earnings over 6 rounds
while being in different groups of 4 each time. In the Basic condition,
Player_14 is in Group_6 with Player_23, Player_21, and Player_2 for Round 1,

in different groups of 4 each time. In the Basic condition, Player_14 is in
Group_6 with Player_23, Player_21, and Player_2 for Round 1, with no gossip or
ostracism involved.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_14 is participating in a public goods game,
where they must decide how much of their $10 to contribute to a group fund in
Round 1. They are in Group_6 with Player_23, Player_21, and Player_2. Any
contributions to the group fund are doubled and evenly distributed among group
members, and the game is in the Basic condition, which means there is no gossip
or ostracism affecting decisions.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Player_14 will need to consider the potential outcomes of different contribution
strategies. If Player_14 contributes the full $10, and everyone else does the
same, the group fund will reach $40, be multiplied to $80, and Player_14 will
receive $20 back. This results in a net profit of $10. Alternatively, if
Player_14 contributes $0 while others contribute $10 each, the group fund will
be $30, multiplied to $60, and each person will receive $15. In this case,
Player_14 will retain the original $10 and receive $15, totaling $25. A
middle-ground strategy, contributing $5, could yield $17.50 if others contribute
$10 each. This strategy balances between altruism and self-interest. Given these
considerations, maximizing earnings without any ostracism or gossip
repercussions suggests a strategic approach. To optimize for the highest
potential gain within the round's constraints, Player_14 might choose lower
contributions to leverage others’ investments. Thus, a decision to minimize risk
and preserve maximum gains might lead to the following decision: I choose to
contribute $0 to the group fund.

--- Recent context ---
26 Mar 2025 [11:34:17 - 16:34:17]: Player_14 is participating in an economic
game with 24 participants, aiming to maximize earnings over 6 rounds while being
in a new group each round. In Round 1, in the Basic condition with no gossip or
ostracism, Player_14 contributed $0, earning $16 total, while the group
contributed $12 overall, resulting in an average earning of $13 per member.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_14 is in Round 2 of the economic game and
has been assigned to Group_3 with Player_2, Player_12, and Player_9. They are
still in the Basic condition, where there is no gossip or ostracism, and their
goal remains to maximize their earnings by deciding how much to contribute to
the group's fund.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Player_14 will need to consider the potential outcomes and previous experiences.
In Round 1, contributing $0 allowed them to earn $16, as others in the group
contributed enough to still yield a positive return. 1. **Objective:** Maximize
personal earnings in the game. 2. **Past Experience:** In the first round,
contributing nothing resulted in higher earnings than if they had contributed
due to others' contributions. 3. **Group Dynamics:** Since there is no gossip or
ostracism, future rounds will not be influenced by previous actions. Players
cannot coordinate or retaliate based on past behavior. 4. **Potential
Strategies:** - Contributing $0: Maximizes personal retention of initial capital
while still benefiting from the group fund. - Contributing a small amount: May
encourage others to contribute more in the spirit of fairness, but historically
might still yield less than contributing nothing if others don't increase their
contributions proportionally. 5. **Calculation Examples:** - If they contribute
$0 again and others contribute similarly as in Round 1, they may continue to
maximize earnings. - If they decide to contribute something this time, it's a
risk that depends on other players’ reactions, which is unpredictable. Given
these considerations, sticking with the initial strategy that maximized earnings
seems rational at this point. Therefore: I choose to contribute $0 to the group
fund.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_14 is in Round 3 of 6 and has been assigned

others.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Player_14 will evaluate the strategy based on previous rounds. In Round 1 and
Round 2, Player_14 contributed $0 and achieved higher than average earnings by
leveraging the contributions of others while keeping all their initial $10. This
strategy maximized personal earnings. Observing this pattern, continuing with a
$0 contribution might be advantageous since it allows Player_14 to benefit from
others' contributions without reducing their own private account. Given this
reasoning, maintaining the current approach seems optimal for maximizing
earnings. Therefore, I choose to contribute $0 to the group fund.

each time. Despite being in a setting without gossip or ostracism, Player_14 has
consistently opted not to contribute to the group fund, thereby focusing on
maximizing personal earnings from the group's contributions while maintaining a
strategy of non-contribution.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Player_14 will likely choose to contribute $0. Given Player_14's consistent
behavior across the initial rounds, where they opted not to contribute in order
to maximize personal earnings while benefiting from the group's contributions,
it stands to reason that they will continue with this strategy. In this economic
game, the rational decision-making approach for Player_14 would focus on
maintaining maximum personal gain while relying on other players to contribute
to the group fund. Sociologically, without the influence of gossip or ostracism,
there is reduced social pressure or incentive for Player_14 to change their
strategy. Therefore, I choose to contribute $0 to the group fund.

The current situation is that Player_14 is in Round 5 of a six-round public

Player_14 will evaluate the strategy that has consistently maximized personal
