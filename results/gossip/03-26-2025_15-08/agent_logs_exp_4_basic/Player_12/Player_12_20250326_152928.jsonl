In the Basic condition, without gossip or ostracism, Player_12 consistently contributes some money to the group fund, but the overall group contributions and earnings fluctuate, with Player_12's personal earnings varying across the rounds.", "", "Situation Analysis: The current situation is that Player_12 is in the final round of the public goods game, specifically in Round 6 out of 6. They are grouped with Player_6, Player_5, and Player_18. In each previous round, Player_12 has contributed to the group fund, facing varied levels of contributions from others which have affected the total earnings for each group member. The game is conducted in the Basic condition, meaning there is no gossip or ostracism to influence decisions. Player_12 must decide how much to contribute in this last round, considering past experiences and the behavior of new group members.", "", "Decision Reflection: Player_12 will analyze the patterns from previous rounds. In the last round (Round 5), contributing $3.0 resulted in relatively high personal earnings, as the overall group contribution allowed for a good return from the group fund. In previous rounds, higher contributions from Player_12 resulted in minimal earnings increase due to low contributions from some group members. With this in mind, contributing a moderate amount might strike a balance between risk and return, considering the lack of gossip or ostracism and varying group dynamics. Thus, I choose to contribute $3.0 to the group fund.", "", "Exercise: As Player_12, you have $10.0 to allocate in the public goods game. How much money you will contribute to the group fund (any amount between $0 and $10.0)? The group fund will be multiplied by 2.0 and divided equally among all players. Any money not contributed stays in your private account. Think step by step and make your final decision using this exact format: I choose to contribute $X to the group fund.", "Answer: Player_12 chooses to contribute $3.0 to the group fund."]}
