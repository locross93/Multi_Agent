[OBSERVATION 2025-03-26 15:29:29] You are participating in an economic game with 24 participants.
        Your goal is to maximize your earnings in the game.
        
        Everyone will be randomly assigned to groups of 4 for each round. You will play a total of 6 rounds, and 
        in each round you will be in a different group with people you haven't played with before.
        
        In each round, all players receive $10. Each player can contribute any amount between $0 and $10 to a group fund.
        Any amount contributed to the group fund will be multiplied by 2 and divided equally among all 4 group members.
        Any amount not contributed stays in your private account.
        
        For example, if everyone contributes $10, the group fund becomes $40, which is multiplied to $80, and each person 
        receives $20 (a $10 profit). However, if you contribute nothing while everyone else contributes $10, the group fund
        becomes $30, which is multiplied to $60, and each person receives $15. So you would have $25 total ($10 kept + $15 from group).
        
        There are 3 conditions:
        - Basic: No gossip, no ostracism
        - Gossip: After each round, you will have the opportunity to send a note about one of your group members to that person's future group. Remember you will be with a different group of people in the next round. Before each round, you will see any notes sent about your upcoming group members.
        - Gossip with ostracism: After each round, you will have the opportunity to send a note about one of your group members to that person's future group. Before each round, you will see any notes sent about your upcoming group members, and you can vote to exclude one person from your group. If you are excluded from a group, you will not be able to participate in the next round and will earn $0 for that round.
        You are in the Basic condition, which means that there is no gossip or ostracism.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_13 is in the first round of a public goods
game in the Basic condition, where they are grouped with three other players
(Player_18, Player_8, and Player_16). Each player has $10, which they can choose
to contribute to a group fund. The contributions to the group fund are
multiplied and redistributed equally among the group members. Player_13's
objective is to maximize their earnings over the course of the game.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Player_13 will consider the strategy of maximizing both personal gain and
collective gain. In the Basic condition, without gossip or ostracism, the
decision relies strictly on self-interest and cooperation with the group.

--- Recent context ---
26 Mar 2025 [11:34:17 - 16:34:17]: Player_13 is participating in a six-round
economic game with 24 players, where they need to maximize earnings by
contributing to a group fund. In the Basic condition without gossip or
ostracism, Player_13 contributed $10 in the first round, earning $10 from the
group fund, and is now in the second round with a new group.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_13 is in Round 2 of the economic game,
newly assigned to Group_6 with Players 19, 24, and 17. Since they are in the
Basic condition, there is no opportunity for gossip or ostracism. Player_13's
challenge remains to decide how much to contribute to the group fund in an
effort to maximize their earnings without knowing the contribution levels of
other players.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Player_13 will consider their previous experience and the goal of maximizing
earnings. In Round 1, contributing the full $10 resulted in breaking even
because the average contribution per player was only $5. Not all players
maximized the potential gains. In this second round, Player_13 could contribute
less to ensure a personal gain regardless of the others' contributions. If
Player_13 lowers their contribution, they minimize personal loss if other
players contribute less again. Given the lack of communication or consequences
due to the Basic condition, Player_13 might prefer a conservative approach.
Therefore, a strategic decision would involve contributing less than $10 while
still contributing enough to potentially profit from others' higher
contributions. A balanced strategy could be to contribute around $5, allowing
them to keep some amount private while still being part of the group effort. I
choose to contribute $5 to the group fund.

The current situation is that Player_13 is about to start Round 3/6 in the Basic
condition of the economic game. They are in a new group with Player_8,
Player_24, and Player_16. In this condition, there is no possibility of gossip
or ostracism, so Player_13 will need to decide how much to contribute to the
group fund without external influences from previous rounds. They will yet again
aim to maximize their earnings based on their contribution and the contributions
of their new group members.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Player_13 will consider several factors before making a decision on how much to
contribute in Round 3. 1. **Previous Contributions**: In Round 1, Player_13
contributed $10 and earned $10 back due to others contributing less. In Round 2,
Player_13 contributed $5, and the group's average contribution was lower,
resulting in an earnings increase to $14.5. 2. **Behavior of Group Members**:
With different members in each round, it's important to assess the potential
strategies of Player_8 (previously a low contributor), Player_24 (also a low
contributor), and Player_16 (who contributed nothing in Round 1). The historical
behavior of these players might suggest they are less likely to contribute
maximum amounts. 3. **Strategic Consideration**: Given the lack of gossip or
ostracism, there's less social pressure to contribute more or less based on
reputation. Therefore, maximizing personal earnings while considering potential
average group contributions is crucial. 4. **Decision Making**: To optimize
earnings based on previous rounds, a mid-range contribution might balance risk
and reward. Contributing too much when others may contribute less could reduce
potential earnings. I choose to contribute $5.0 to the group fund.

taking into account the contributions of the other group members and the absence
of mechanisms for gossip or ostracism.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Player_13 will first review the outcomes of previous rounds. Round 1 showed that
contributing half of their allocation led to balanced earnings, while in Round
2, a smaller contribution still maintained a decent earning despite a drop in
group contributions. Round 3 highlighted a noteworthy presence of free-riders,
like Player_16, who didn't contribute at all. Player_13 might weigh the risks
and benefits of strategic contribution. In Round 4, with different players,
they'll need to assess new group dynamics. Given the absence of gossip or
ostracism, maintaining a stable yet cautious strategy, avoiding extreme
measures, might be sensible. Thus, Player_13 might opt to contribute a moderate
amount, ensuring reasonable earnings while testing the group's cooperative
nature. In conclusion, I choose to contribute $5.0 to the group fund.

maximizing earnings over six rounds. Positioned in the Basic condition lacking
gossip or ostracism, Player_13 experienced varying group dynamics, adjusting
contributions to balance personal gains with collective results.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_13 is in the fifth round of a six-round
public goods game, grouped with Player_10, Player_9, and Player_24. In this
Basic condition, there is no aspect of gossip or ostracism that affects
gameplay. Player_13 needs to decide on a contribution strategy that will
optimize their personal earnings while also considering the total group
contribution and its impact on shared group funds.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Player_13 will first consider the outcomes of previous rounds and how different
contribution levels affected both personal and group earnings. In Round 2, a
$5.0 contribution aligned with the average and resulted in decent earnings. In
Round 3, a slightly smaller $4.0 contribution was made, and in Round 4, a $5.0
contribution was maintained. Player_13 seems to favor a strategy that maintains
a moderate level of contribution to ensure reasonable returns from the group
fund while also maximizing personal savings. Observing that personal
contributions frequently fell in the $4.0 to $5.0 range suggests Player_13 is
likely comfortable with this level of risk and potential reward. Taking all of
this into consideration, Player_13 should aim to balance the potential reward
from the group fund with personal savings, especially given the game's structure
where the group fund is doubled and split evenly. In this round, aiming for
consistency while considering the tendency for others in the group to contribute
variably, a contribution that sustains group trust and potential earnings,
without being overly generous, seems strategic. Therefore, I choose to
contribute $5.0 to the group fund.

The current situation is that Player_13 is in the final round (Round 6/6) of a

contribute to the group fund.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Player_13 will consider the outcomes of previous rounds to decide on the optimal
contribution. In Round 3, where Player_13 contributed $4.0, the individual
earnings were fairly balanced with contributions, and in Round 4, with a
contribution of $5.0, earnings were improved slightly, indicating that higher
contributions can lead to collectively better returns. Moving to Round 5, where
a contribution of $5.0 again resulted in the highest group earnings seen,
suggests that maintaining or slightly increasing contributions could be
beneficial. Considering these outcomes and the potential benefit of
collaborative contribution amplified by the multiplier, a balanced contribution
will likely yield favorable results. I choose to contribute $5.0 to the group
fund.
