[OBSERVATION 2025-03-26 15:29:28] You are participating in an economic game with 24 participants.
        Your goal is to maximize your earnings in the game.
        
        Everyone will be randomly assigned to groups of 4 for each round. You will play a total of 6 rounds, and 
        in each round you will be in a different group with people you haven't played with before.
        
        In each round, all players receive $10. Each player can contribute any amount between $0 and $10 to a group fund.
        Any amount contributed to the group fund will be multiplied by 2 and divided equally among all 4 group members.
        Any amount not contributed stays in your private account.
        
        For example, if everyone contributes $10, the group fund becomes $40, which is multiplied to $80, and each person 
        receives $20 (a $10 profit). However, if you contribute nothing while everyone else contributes $10, the group fund
        becomes $30, which is multiplied to $60, and each person receives $15. So you would have $25 total ($10 kept + $15 from group).
        
        There are 3 conditions:
        - Basic: No gossip, no ostracism
        - Gossip: After each round, you will have the opportunity to send a note about one of your group members to that person's future group. Remember you will be with a different group of people in the next round. Before each round, you will see any notes sent about your upcoming group members.
        - Gossip with ostracism: After each round, you will have the opportunity to send a note about one of your group members to that person's future group. Before each round, you will see any notes sent about your upcoming group members, and you can vote to exclude one person from your group. If you are excluded from a group, you will not be able to participate in the next round and will earn $0 for that round.
        You are in the Basic condition, which means that there is no gossip or ostracism.

--- Recent context ---
26 Mar 2025 [11:34:17 - 16:34:17]: Player_2 is participating in an economic game
with 24 participants, divided into groups of 4 for each round, aiming to
maximize their earnings by deciding how much to contribute to a group fund. In
the Basic condition without gossip or ostracism, they have completed Round 1
with a $5 contribution and earned $11, and are now in Round 2 with different
group members.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_2 is in Round 2 of 6 in a public goods game
with 23 other participants. They're in a new group with Player_12, Player_14,
and Player_9 under the Basic condition, meaning there is no gossip or ostracism
involved. Player_2 must decide how much of their $10 to contribute to the
group's fund, which will be doubled and split equally among the group members,
aiming to maximize their individual earnings.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Player_2 will consider that in Round 1, contributing $5 to the group fund
resulted in total earnings of $11, which was slightly below the average earnings
of $13 per group member. Observing Player_14's strategy of contributing nothing
and maximizing private earnings may suggest a potential tendency for others to
contribute less. Balancing the goal of maximizing personal earnings with the
possibility of cooperation from other group members, Player_2 might decide to
adjust the contribution. With the understanding that total group contributions
are doubled and redistributed, contributing too little might lead to lower group
fund growth, whereas contributing more might encourage others to increase their
contributions in later rounds. Wanting to navigate this strategic environment
effectively and perhaps improve total earnings, Player_2 may opt for a moderate
contribution, enough to encourage others without risking too much personal
allocation. After considering these factors, Player_2 may decide: I choose to
contribute $4 to the group fund.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_2 is about to start Round 3 in the public
goods game. They are grouped with Player_22, Player_19, and Player_9, and remain
in the Basic condition without gossip or ostracism. In previous rounds, Player_2
has contributed moderately, which resulted in earnings slightly above the
average compared to their group members. As they enter this new round, Player_2
aims to optimize their strategy to maximize earnings while adapting to the
contributions and behaviors of their new group members.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Player_2 will consider the context of previous rounds. In Round 1, with a
moderate contribution of $5.0, Player_2 earned slightly less than the group
member who contributed the least but more than those who contributed equally. In
Round 2, contributing $4.0 resulted in an improved outcome, earning slightly
above average. Given the current group's dynamics, without prior knowledge of
Player_22 and Player_19's behavior, and Player_9 having previously contributed
moderately, Player_2 might anticipate possible strategic conservatism or
cooperation. A balanced strategy might be prudent to maximize potential earnings
while maintaining a favorable position within the group. Therefore, Player_2 may
opt for a slightly lower contribution compared to previous rounds to capitalize
on personal retention while still contributing significantly to the fund. I
choose to contribute $3.0 to the group fund.

Player_2 will analyze the previous rounds to make a strategic decision. 1.
**Round Analysis**: - **Round 1**: Contributed $5.0 and earned $11.0. The
average contribution was $3.0. - **Round 2**: Contributed $4.0 and earned $13.0.
The average contribution slightly increased to $3.5. - **Round 3**: Contributed
$3.0 and earned $16.5, with an average contribution of $4.8. 2. **Observation**:
- The trend shows that reducing contributions slightly in Round 3 increased
Player_2’s earnings, suggesting other players compensated with higher
contributions. 3. **Current Round Dynamics**: - The current group includes
Player_8, Player_21, and Player_16. Past data on these players is limited, but
Player_21 has shown consistent contributions matching Player_2’s own
contributions in Round 1. 4. **Decision Making**: - Given that higher earnings
occurred in Round 3 with a lower contribution, Player_2 might aim to balance
maximizing individual earnings and maintaining a reasonable group contribution.
- Contributing moderately can encourage others to maintain or increase their
contributions without significantly reducing Player_2's potential earnings from
the group fund. 5. **Final Decision**: - Based on the past outcomes and
strategic balance between self-interest and group earnings, a moderate
contribution could optimize results. I choose to contribute $4.0 to the group
fund.

Player_2 noticed that contributing slightly below the average often resulted in
favorable earnings. - It's important to note the absence of contributions by
some players, indicating a potential strategy to balance cooperation and
self-interest might be effective. 3. **Strategic Decision**: - The average
contributions from previous rounds were around $3.1 to $4.8. - To optimize
earnings, contributing slightly above the minimum but below the previous average
might maximize the return from the group fund. 4. **Final Decision**: - With the
understanding that a moderate contribution often results in a significant group
fund share, while allowing some private savings, Player_2 aims for an optimal
balance. I choose to contribute $3.0 to the group fund.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_2 has entered the final round of a public
goods game, where they are grouped with Player_10, Player_16, and Player_17.
Player_2 must decide on their contribution to the group fund, knowing that all
earnings are affected by the contributions of each group member. They are also
aware that they are in the Basic condition, which does not allow for gossip or

without external social pressures. Their past rounds have shown varying results
based on both their own and others' contributions, influencing potential

--- Decision Reflection ---
Player_2 will first consider the previous rounds to evaluate the behavior of
other players and the outcomes. In past rounds, Player_2 contributed between
$3.0 and $3.5 while noticing varying contributions from other group members,
ranging from $0.0 to $6.0. Player_2 often aimed for a balanced approach,
retaining a moderate portion of their initial $10.0 to ensure some individual
earnings while still contributing enough to gain significantly from the group
fund multiplier. Moreover, this strategy usually resulted in average or
above-average earnings per member across the rounds. For Round 6, since
Player_16 and Player_17 have appeared in past rounds and demonstrated varying
contributions, Player_2 might predict their potential behaviors. Additionally,
Player_10, who is new to Player_2, introduces some uncertainty.
