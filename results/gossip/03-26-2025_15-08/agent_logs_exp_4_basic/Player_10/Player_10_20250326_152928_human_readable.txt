[OBSERVATION 2025-03-26 15:29:28] You are participating in an economic game with 24 participants.
        Your goal is to maximize your earnings in the game.
        
        Everyone will be randomly assigned to groups of 4 for each round. You will play a total of 6 rounds, and 
        in each round you will be in a different group with people you haven't played with before.
        
        In each round, all players receive $10. Each player can contribute any amount between $0 and $10 to a group fund.
        Any amount contributed to the group fund will be multiplied by 2 and divided equally among all 4 group members.
        Any amount not contributed stays in your private account.
        
        For example, if everyone contributes $10, the group fund becomes $40, which is multiplied to $80, and each person 
        receives $20 (a $10 profit). However, if you contribute nothing while everyone else contributes $10, the group fund
        becomes $30, which is multiplied to $60, and each person receives $15. So you would have $25 total ($10 kept + $15 from group).
        
        There are 3 conditions:
        - Basic: No gossip, no ostracism
        - Gossip: After each round, you will have the opportunity to send a note about one of your group members to that person's future group. Remember you will be with a different group of people in the next round. Before each round, you will see any notes sent about your upcoming group members.
        - Gossip with ostracism: After each round, you will have the opportunity to send a note about one of your group members to that person's future group. Before each round, you will see any notes sent about your upcoming group members, and you can vote to exclude one person from your group. If you are excluded from a group, you will not be able to participate in the next round and will earn $0 for that round.
        You are in the Basic condition, which means that there is no gossip or ostracism.

Recent context: 26 Mar 2025 [11:29:17 - 16:29:17]: Player_10 is participating in
an economic game with 24 participants, aiming to maximize earnings by
contributing to group funds across 6 rounds. In Round 1, Player_10 is in Group_4
with Player_5, Player_11, and Player_6, under the Basic condition without gossip

26 Mar 2025 [11:29:17 - 16:29:17]: Player_10 is participating in an economic

funds across 6 rounds. In Round 1, Player_10 is in Group_4 with Player_5,
Player_11, and Player_6, under the Basic condition without gossip or ostracism.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_10 is in Round 1 of the public goods game,
grouped with three other players, and must decide how much of their initial $10
to contribute to the group fund, balancing personal gain with collective
benefit, without any influence from gossip or the threat of ostracism.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Player_10 will evaluate their strategy by considering the potential outcomes of
contributing different amounts. If Player_10 contributes all $10, the group fund
could increase significantly, maximizing potential returns if others contribute
similarly. However, contributing nothing and relying on others to contribute
could lead to a higher personal total if others contribute the full amount.
Balancing personal gain with group cooperation is key. Assuming Player_10 wants
to foster good group dynamics while also ensuring personal profit, a moderate
contribution might be optimal. Therefore, I choose to contribute $5 to the group
fund.

26 Mar 2025 [11:34:17 - 16:34:17]: Player_10 is participating in an economic
game with 24 participants, where they aim to maximize their earnings over six
rounds, each with a different group of players. In the Basic condition with no
gossip or ostracism, Player_10 contributed $5 in Round 1 and earned $15, and is
now in Round 2 with a new group.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_10 is participating in Round 2 of a public
goods game in the Basic condition, meaning there is no gossip or ostracism. They
are in Group_2 with Player_15, Player_11, and Player_16. Their goal continues to
be maximizing earnings, and they have already played one round where they
contributed $5 and earned $15.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Player_10 will likely consider several factors based on their previous
experience in Round 1 and the nature of the game. In Round 1, Player_10
contributed $5, which was the average contribution, and resulted in reasonable
earnings without risking too much personal capital. In this Basic condition with
no gossip or ostracism, Player_10 does not need to worry about being penalized
in future rounds for their contribution choice, nor will they benefit from
information about others' behaviors beyond their immediate group experiences.
Considering these factors, Player_10 might decide to continue a similar strategy
to foster cooperation among group members while still securing personal
earnings. Thus, they might opt for a balanced approach, contributing neither the
maximum nor the minimum amount, aiming to maintain a steady income across
rounds. I choose to contribute $5 to the group fund.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_10 is about to start Round 3 of the public
goods game, where they are grouped with Player_17, Player_5, and Player_6. They
are still under the Basic condition, meaning there will be no gossip or
ostracism influencing group dynamics. In this round, Player_10 will need to
decide how much to contribute to the group fund in order to maximize their
earnings, taking into consideration the potential contributions and behaviors of
their new group members.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Player_10 will examine the past rounds to make an informed decision. In both
previous rounds, contributing $5.0 resulted in varying earnings depending on the
overall contribution of the group. In Round 1, with everyone contributing
equally, Player_10 earned a satisfactory $15.0. In Round 2, despite maintaining
the same level of contribution, the earnings dropped to $11.0 due to a lower
group total. This reflects that individual contributions, while important, must
align with group dynamics to maximize returns. Given the new group composition
in Round 3, Player_10 should consider the contribution pattern from the past
rounds (notably encountering Player_5 and Player_6 again). Both made equal
contributions in the first round, hinting at possible cooperation that could
benefit Player_10 if sustained. Therefore, continuing to contribute $5.0 might
encourage group cooperation and potentially lead to increased total group
earnings. I choose to contribute $5.0 to the group fund.

Player_10 will assess their previous rounds to decide on the contribution. So
far, Player_10 has consistently contributed $5.0 to the group fund while

1. Consistency has been a strategy so far, with Player_10 consistently
contributing $5.0. 2. In both Rounds 4 and 5, the total group contribution was
$19.0 despite different group compositions, indicating that similar group
dynamics are present regardless of specific members. 3. Consistent contributions
have ensured a reasonable return ($14.5) beyond the initial contribution. 4. The

benefitting from the collective group fund multiplication. Considering these
points, I choose to contribute $5.0 to the group fund.
