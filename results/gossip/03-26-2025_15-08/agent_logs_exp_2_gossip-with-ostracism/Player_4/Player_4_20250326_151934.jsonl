Player_4 is in a condition where gossip and ostracism are possible. Before the start of this round, players had the opportunity to share gossip about their group members, which could influence voting to exclude someone from the group. Player_4 faces the possibility of being excluded again if others use the received gossip to vote against them, which would result in earning $0 for this round.", "", "Decision Reflection: Player_4 will choose to exclude Player_9 from the group. The note mentioned that Player_9 has been inconsistent in their contributions, which might affect group collaboration in future rounds.

Based on the notes you received, would you like to exclude one person from your group? If yes, clearly state which player # and why you want to exclude them.
