[OBSERVATION 2025-03-26 15:19:45] You are participating in an economic game with 24 participants.
        Your goal is to maximize your earnings in the game.
        
        Everyone will be randomly assigned to groups of 4 for each round. You will play a total of 6 rounds, and 
        in each round you will be in a different group with people you haven't played with before.
        
        In each round, all players receive $10. Each player can contribute any amount between $0 and $10 to a group fund.
        Any amount contributed to the group fund will be multiplied by 2 and divided equally among all 4 group members.
        Any amount not contributed stays in your private account.
        
        For example, if everyone contributes $10, the group fund becomes $40, which is multiplied to $80, and each person 
        receives $20 (a $10 profit). However, if you contribute nothing while everyone else contributes $10, the group fund
        becomes $30, which is multiplied to $60, and each person receives $15. So you would have $25 total ($10 kept + $15 from group).
        
        There are 3 conditions:
        - Basic: No gossip, no ostracism
        - Gossip: After each round, you will have the opportunity to send a note about one of your group members to that person's future group. Remember you will be with a different group of people in the next round. Before each round, you will see any notes sent about your upcoming group members.
        - Gossip with ostracism: After each round, you will have the opportunity to send a note about one of your group members to that person's future group. Before each round, you will see any notes sent about your upcoming group members, and you can vote to exclude one person from your group. If you are excluded from a group, you will not be able to participate in the next round and will earn $0 for that round.
        You are in the Basic condition, which means that there is no gossip or ostracism.

Recent context: 26 Mar 2025 [11:19:34 - 16:19:34]: Player_15 is participating in
an economic game with 24 participants, aimed at maximizing personal earnings
over six rounds, each involving different group members. Player_15 is currently
in Round 1, Group 6 with others, and is in the Basic condition where neither
gossip nor ostracism is allowed.

rounds, each involving different group members. Player_15 is currently in Round
1, Group 6 with others, and is in the Basic condition where neither gossip nor
ostracism is allowed.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_15 is participating in Round 1 of a
six-round economic game with a goal to maximize earnings. In this round, they
are in a group with Player_5, Player_6, and Player_20. Each participant begins
with $10 and must decide how much to contribute to a group fund. Contributions
to the fund are doubled and split equally among the group members. Player_15 is
in the Basic condition, meaning the game does not involve gossip or ostracism,
which are factors in other conditions that could influence the game's outcome
and strategy.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Player_15 will consider the incentives and strategic implications of the
situation. Each contribution increases the group fund, which benefits all
members equally. Contributing more can lead to larger overall group earnings,
but there's also the temptation to retain money for personal advantage,
especially when no retaliation (gossip or ostracism) is present. Since the
strategy involves maximizing personal earnings while relying on equal
contributions from others, Player_15 might choose a balanced approach by
contributing a moderate amount. If Player_15 expects others to contribute fully,
contributing less would maximize their personal gain while still benefiting from
the multiplied group fund. Conversely, if Player_15 anticipates low
contributions from the group, they may consider contributing more to encourage
higher total payouts. Given the absence of feedback mechanisms like gossip or
ostracism, and assuming rational behavior from others seeking to maximize their
profits, Player_15 might opt to contribute an amount that influences others to
contribute without sacrificing all personal reserves. Therefore, I choose to
contribute $5 to the group fund.

--- Recent context ---
26 Mar 2025 [11:24:34 - 16:24:34]: Player_15 is participating in an economic
game with 24 participants, aiming to maximize their earnings by contributing
strategically to a group fund in a series of six rounds. In the first round,
they were part of Group_6 and contributed $5.0, resulting in total earnings of
$17.5, and are currently entering Round 2 in Group_2, all under the Basic
condition, with no gossip or ostracism involved.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_15 is entering Round 2 of the public goods
game as part of Group_2, along with Player_12, Player_2, and Player_9. The goal
remains to maximize earnings by deciding how much to contribute to the group
fund. In this Basic condition, Player_15 does not have to worry about gossip or
being ostracized, as neither is allowed. They must strategically decide their
contribution level to optimize their earnings, considering the potential
contributions of their new group members.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Player_15 will consider the previous round's outcome. In Round 1, contributing
$5.0 resulted in decent earnings, while Player_20, who contributed the full $10,
ended up with the lowest earnings due to the distribution mechanism. The
strategy should maximize personal earnings while encouraging a reasonable group
contribution. 1. If Player_15 contributes nothing and others contribute $5, the
group fund would be $15, multiplied to $30, and each person would receive $7.5
from the group fund. Player_15 would then have a total of $17.5 ($10 kept + $7.5
from group). 2. If Player_15 contributes $10 and others contribute nothing, they
would end up with only $5 from the group fund for a total of $5. 3. If Player_15
contributes $5 again, and others also contribute $5, the group fund becomes $20,
multiplied to $40, resulting in $10 per person from the group fund. Player_15
would have a total of $15 ($5 kept + $10 from group). Considering these
scenarios, a balanced approach like Round 1 seems optimal. The strategy should
aim to maintain group cooperation while maximizing individual benefits under the
Basic condition. Therefore: I choose to contribute $5 to the group fund.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Player_15 will consider the outcomes of previous rounds to make a strategic
decision. In Round 1, contributing $5.0 led to decent earnings compared to the
overall average. In Round 2, the earnings were less optimal due to lower group
contributions. Being in the Basic condition means there is limited risk of
exclusion, so finding a balance between selfish and cooperative strategies is
key. Maintaining a consistent contribution might help influence others to
increase their contributions without risking too much personally. Therefore, to
maintain a consistent strategy while encouraging group cooperation, I choose to
contribute $5.0 to the group fund.

The current situation is that Player_15 is in Round 4 of 6 in the public goods
game, where they are grouped with Player_5, Player_4, and Player_20. They are in
the Basic condition, with no gossip or ostracism influencing their decisions.
While consistently contributing $5 in each previous round, Player_15's earnings
and the dynamics within the group have varied due to the differing contribution
levels from other group members.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Player_15 will start by assessing previous rounds' outcomes. In rounds 1, 2, and
3, I contributed $5 each time. This strategy provided varying earnings based on
the total group contributions but allowed me to maintain a consistent approach.
I consider the implications of contributing more or less than in previous
rounds. If I contribute more than $5, my increased contribution would boost the
group fund significantly, but my private account would decrease, leaving me with
less immediate security. Conversely, contributing less might result in higher
private earnings but could lead to a reduced group fund and lower total earnings
from the distribution. Reflecting on past rounds, my consistent $5 contribution
offers a balanced approach, allowing me to remain cooperative without overly
depleting my private account. The average contributions per group member in past
rounds have been close to my contribution amount, indicating that this level is
generally aligned with group behavior. Therefore, maintaining consistency is
reasonable unless my observation of group behavior in future rounds suggests a
change. I choose to contribute $5 to the group fund.

Player_15 will assess the previous rounds' contributions and consider the
overall strategy. In past rounds, Player_15 consistently contributed $5. This
approach has generally provided balanced earnings by ensuring a reasonable
individual payoff both from the group fund and the private account. Given the
pattern of collaboration at a moderate contribution level that benefits all, and
in the spirit of maintaining a cooperative stance, Player_15 might decide to
maintain this strategy. Additionally, the cooperative nature demonstrated in the
last round suggests a higher total group collaboration, which encourages similar
behavior. Thus, maintaining consistent contributions could further nurture this
environment. I choose to contribute $5 to the group fund.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_15 is in the final round of a public goods

--- Decision Reflection ---
Player_15 will consider their previous strategy and the outcomes from past
rounds. They've consistently contributed $5.0 in each round, maintaining a
balanced approach between contributing to the group fund and keeping a portion
for their private account. Observing that other players often contribute similar
amounts and that higher group contributions increase earnings for everyone,
continuing this strategy seems reasonable. Given there is no gossip or
