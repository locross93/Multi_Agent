[OBSERVATION 2025-03-26 15:19:44] You are participating in an economic game with 24 participants.
        Your goal is to maximize your earnings in the game.
        
        Everyone will be randomly assigned to groups of 4 for each round. You will play a total of 6 rounds, and 
        in each round you will be in a different group with people you haven't played with before.
        
        In each round, all players receive $10. Each player can contribute any amount between $0 and $10 to a group fund.
        Any amount contributed to the group fund will be multiplied by 2 and divided equally among all 4 group members.
        Any amount not contributed stays in your private account.
        
        For example, if everyone contributes $10, the group fund becomes $40, which is multiplied to $80, and each person 
        receives $20 (a $10 profit). However, if you contribute nothing while everyone else contributes $10, the group fund
        becomes $30, which is multiplied to $60, and each person receives $15. So you would have $25 total ($10 kept + $15 from group).
        
        There are 3 conditions:
        - Basic: No gossip, no ostracism
        - Gossip: After each round, you will have the opportunity to send a note about one of your group members to that person's future group. Remember you will be with a different group of people in the next round. Before each round, you will see any notes sent about your upcoming group members.
        - Gossip with ostracism: After each round, you will have the opportunity to send a note about one of your group members to that person's future group. Before each round, you will see any notes sent about your upcoming group members, and you can vote to exclude one person from your group. If you are excluded from a group, you will not be able to participate in the next round and will earn $0 for that round.
        You are in the Basic condition, which means that there is no gossip or ostracism.

game with 24 participants, aiming to maximize earnings across 6 rounds in
randomly assigned groups of 4, under the Basic condition where there is no

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_11 is in Round 1 of 6 of the economic game,
playing in Group_3 with Player_8, Player_7, and Player_4. In this round,
Player_11 needs to decide how much of the $10 received to contribute to the
group fund, knowing that any contribution will be doubled and shared equally
among the four group members. The goal is to maximize personal earnings,
balancing between contributing to the public good and retaining private funds.
Since Player_11 is in the Basic condition, they do not have the option to send
or receive notes about other players or vote to exclude someone in future
rounds.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Player_11 will need to balance between contributing enough to benefit from the
collective increase and conserving personal funds for a better net outcome.

an economic game over six rounds, aiming to maximize earnings by contributing to

have completed the first two rounds with consistent contributions of $5,
resulting in group earnings based on total contributions.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_11 is about to participate in Round 3 of
the economic game, being in Group 6 with Player_17, Player_1, and Player_22.
They are continuing to play under the Basic condition, which means there is no
gossip or ostracism involved. So far, they have consistently contributed $5 in
the first two rounds, aligning with some group members but slightly ahead of
others in terms of contributions. This strategy has resulted in earnings of
$14.5 per round. The challenge remains to decide on a contribution strategy that
maximizes personal earnings while considering the potential contributions from
the new group members.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Player_11 will consider the following steps: 1. **Objective**: Maximize earnings
in each round by strategically deciding the contribution to the group fund. 2.
**Current Situation**: Participating in Round 3 with new group members,
Player_17, Player_1, and Player_22. There is no information about specific
behaviors or strategies of these group members since there is no gossip or
ostracism. 3. **Observations from Previous Rounds**: In Rounds 1 and 2,
contributing $5 resulted in relatively balanced outcomes where Player_11
received $14.5 in earnings, slightly below the average. Contributing in a
similar range is a safe strategy under the Basic condition. 4. **Strategic
Considerations**: - The group's total contribution typically hovered around $19,
making a $5 contribution seem reasonable to maintain individual and group
earnings. - Assuming similar group dynamics, a consistent contribution may
prevent suspicion or retaliation from other members. 5. **Decision**: Based on
previous successful outcomes and limited information on fellow group members’
tendencies, opting for a contribution strategy similar to previous rounds seems
prudent. I choose to contribute $5 to the group fund.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_11 is engaged in Round 4 of a six-round
public goods game. They are grouped with Player_6, Player_8, and Player_21, and
are playing without the impact of gossip or ostracism. So far, Player_11 has
consistently contributed $5.0 per round to the group fund and is aiming to
maintain or increase their earnings while navigating different group dynamics.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Player_11 will need to consider several factors before deciding on the
contribution amount: 1. **Contribution in Previous Rounds:** So far, Player_11
consistently contributed $5.0 each round and has been used to receiving around
$14.5-$14.8 in total earnings. This has been working well, ensuring a fair share
of the group fund while keeping a balanced personal account. 2. **Current Group
Dynamics:** In the previous rounds, other players in the group also contributed
amounts close to or the same as Player_11's contribution ($5.0 or less). This
reflects a cooperative atmosphere where contributions are somewhat aligned. 3.
**Game Strategy:** Contributing too little might lead to feeling unequally
treated if others contribute more, potentially affecting future rounds if the
game had gossip or ostracism, which it doesn't in the Basic condition.
Contributing too much more than the average won't necessarily guarantee higher
total earnings in this scenario. 4. **Profit Maximization:** With the
contribution multiplied by 2.0 and distributed equally, a return of $9.5-$9.8
from the group fund seems consistent when contributing $5.0. Maintaining this
contribution ensures Player_11 retains a strategic balance between personal and
group fund returns.

The current situation is that Player_11 is in Round 5/6 of the public goods

--- Decision Reflection ---
Player_11 will analyze the current situation based on past observations. In the
previous rounds, Player_11 consistently contributed $5.0, regardless of the
group's total contribution or individual members' behavior. This suggests
Player_11 values a stable contribution strategy, possibly to maintain fairness
and predictability. 1. **Review Past Behavior**: Player_11 has consistently
contributed $5.0. This strategy provides a balanced approach, ensuring some
personal benefit while also contributing significantly to the group fund. 2.
**Evaluate Group Dynamics**: The group changes each round, meaning the behavior
and contribution levels of other players are unpredictable. Given the basic
condition without gossip or ostracism, contributions are likely aligning with
fairness norms. 3. **Assess Personal Strategy**: Maintaining a stable
contribution could encourage others to adopt similar behavior, potentially
optimizing earnings for everyone in the group. Contributing too much or too
little might not be beneficial given the absence of repercussions or additional
incentives. Given these considerations, Player_11 would likely continue with
their consistent strategy. Therefore, I choose to contribute $5.0 to the group
fund.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Player_11 will likely evaluate past experiences where contributing $5.0 yielded
relatively fair earnings regardless of varying group performance. By
contributing half of the available $10.0, Player_11 balances personal gain while
fostering group cooperation. Observing that similar or slightly greater
contributions typically result in reasonable returns and no penalty for
contributing less, Player_11 may see $5.0 as an optimal balance between
cooperation and self-interest. Therefore, I choose to contribute $5.0 to the
