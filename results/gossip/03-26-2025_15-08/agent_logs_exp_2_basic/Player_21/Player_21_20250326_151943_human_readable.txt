[OBSERVATION 2025-03-26 15:19:45] You are participating in an economic game with 24 participants.
        Your goal is to maximize your earnings in the game.
        
        Everyone will be randomly assigned to groups of 4 for each round. You will play a total of 6 rounds, and 
        in each round you will be in a different group with people you haven't played with before.
        
        In each round, all players receive $10. Each player can contribute any amount between $0 and $10 to a group fund.
        Any amount contributed to the group fund will be multiplied by 2 and divided equally among all 4 group members.
        Any amount not contributed stays in your private account.
        
        For example, if everyone contributes $10, the group fund becomes $40, which is multiplied to $80, and each person 
        receives $20 (a $10 profit). However, if you contribute nothing while everyone else contributes $10, the group fund
        becomes $30, which is multiplied to $60, and each person receives $15. So you would have $25 total ($10 kept + $15 from group).
        
        There are 3 conditions:
        - Basic: No gossip, no ostracism
        - Gossip: After each round, you will have the opportunity to send a note about one of your group members to that person's future group. Remember you will be with a different group of people in the next round. Before each round, you will see any notes sent about your upcoming group members.
        - Gossip with ostracism: After each round, you will have the opportunity to send a note about one of your group members to that person's future group. Before each round, you will see any notes sent about your upcoming group members, and you can vote to exclude one person from your group. If you are excluded from a group, you will not be able to participate in the next round and will earn $0 for that round.
        You are in the Basic condition, which means that there is no gossip or ostracism.

Recent context: 26 Mar 2025 [11:19:34 - 16:19:34]: Player_21 is participating in
an economic game with 24 players, aiming to maximize earnings over six rounds.
In the Basic condition, where there is no gossip or ostracism, Player_21 is
currently in Round 1, grouped with Player_3, Player_16, and Player_17.

26 Mar 2025 [11:19:34 - 16:19:34]: Player_21 is participating in an economic
game with 24 players, aiming to maximize earnings over six rounds. In the Basic
condition, where there is no gossip or ostracism, Player_21 is currently in
Round 1, grouped with Player_3, Player_16, and Player_17.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_21 is in the first round of a public goods
game, grouped with Player_3, Player_16, and Player_17. They each have $10 and
can decide how much to contribute to a group fund, which will be doubled and
evenly distributed among group members. Player_21 is in the Basic condition,
meaning there are no opportunities for gossip or ostracism, focusing purely on
strategic decisions regarding contributions to maximize personal earnings.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Player_21 will consider a strategy that maximizes potential earnings. 1.
Understanding the Rules: Each player starts with $10 per round. Contributions to
the group fund are doubled and divided equally among group members. 2. Scenario
Analysis: - Full Contribution by All: If all players contribute $10, the fund
becomes $40, is doubled to $80, and each receives $20. This results in a $10
profit. - Zero Contribution by One: If Player_21 contributes $0 while others
contribute $10 each, the fund is $30, becomes $60, and each receives $15.
Player_21 keeps their initial $10, totaling $25, which is a $15 profit compared
to the group's $10 profit. 3. Risk Consideration: Since there’s no gossip or
ostracism, Player_21’s minimal contribution won't affect future rounds in terms
of social reputation or exclusion. 4. Decision: - A balance between cooperation
and self-interest is ideal. Contributing $0 benefits most if others contribute
fully; however, to sustain group cooperation and prevent others from changing
strategies, Player_21 might contribute a minimal amount. I choose to contribute
$0 to the group fund.

game where they aim to maximize their earnings over six rounds, each time being
grouped with different participants. In the Basic condition, without gossip or
ostracism, they contributed $2 in the first round, earning $16.5 due to group
contributions.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_21 is entering Round 2/6 of the economic
game and is grouped with Player_5, Player_6, and Player_20. They remain in the
Basic condition, which means there is no gossip or ostracism, and they aim to
decide how much to contribute to the group fund to maximize their earnings.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Player_21 will evaluate their strategy based on maximizing personal earnings
while considering group behavior. In Round 1, Player_21 contributed $2.0 and
earned $16.5, which was higher than the average earnings of $14.2. The strategy
of contributing less while relying on others to contribute more seemed
effective. In Round 2, without knowing the new group's tendencies, Player_21 may
decide to maintain a similar conservative strategy to preserve higher earnings
while allowing for potential higher group contributions. Therefore, in the
current situation, I choose to contribute $2.0 to the group fund.

The current situation is that Player_21 is entering Round 3 of the public goods

still operating under the Basic condition with no gossip or ostracism, and must
decide how much to contribute to the group fund. So far, Player_21 has
consistently contributed $2 in previous rounds, which has influenced their
earnings relative to the group's overall contributions.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Player_21 will analyze the previous rounds to determine the optimal strategy for
contributing to the group fund. In the first two rounds, Player_21 contributed
$2 each time, resulting in relatively higher personal earnings compared to other
players who contributed more. This suggests that a lower contribution maximizes
individual gains when others contribute a moderate amount. Player_21 must
consider that since the condition is "Basic" with no gossip or ostracism,
there's no risk of being excluded or having their behavior relayed to future
groups. Additionally, given that average contributions have hovered around $4 to
$5, it's advantageous to keep contributions low to maximize personal earnings
while still benefiting from the multiplied group fund from other players'
contributions. Therefore, I choose to contribute $2 to the group fund.

their strategy of contributing $2 to the group fund. The basic condition
applies, meaning there are no consequences or advantages such as gossip or
ostracism that might influence contributions or strategies beyond individual
decisions. Player_21 aims to maximize personal earnings while dealing with
varied cooperation levels from different players in each round.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Player_21 will likely decide to follow a similar strategy to previous rounds.
Step by step, they would consider the patterns established in prior rounds,
where they consistently contributed $2, keeping a larger portion for personal
earnings. By maintaining this approach, Player_21 effectively leverages the
multiplication of the group fund without risking personal loss. Since their
contribution results in favorable earnings by balancing personal retention and
collective gain, altering their strategy significantly might introduce
unnecessary risk. Ultimately, consistent contribution has so far aligned with
maximizing their personal benefit. Therefore, I choose to contribute $2 to the
group fund.

terms of individual and average group earnings will depend on the total
contributions made by all group members in this round.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Player_21 will likely consider several factors before deciding on how much to
contribute in the final round. Historically, Player_21 has consistently
contributed $2.0 in each round, indicating a strategy focused on maintaining
personal earnings while modestly contributing to the group. Evaluating the
pattern and game dynamic: 1. Contribution History: Player_21 has maintained a
stable contribution of $2.0, balancing personal gain and group contribution. 2.
Final Round Dynamics: Being the last round, strategic players might alter their
contributions to maximize their final earnings, either by increasing the amount
to foster goodwill (if it affects future interactions beyond the current
context) or sticking to their strategy to ensure a predictable outcome. 3. Stake
of Group Benefit: Even in the final round, maximizing personal earnings can
still be accomplished through maintaining consistent contributions due to the
absence of potential repercussions like gossip or ostracism. Considering these
points, Player_21 might adhere to the established strategy due to its
consistency in previous rounds and lack of external pressures in the Basic
condition. I choose to contribute $2.0 to the group fund.
