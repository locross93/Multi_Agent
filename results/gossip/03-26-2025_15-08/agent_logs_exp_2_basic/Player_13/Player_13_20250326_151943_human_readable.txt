[OBSERVATION 2025-03-26 15:19:44] You are participating in an economic game with 24 participants.
        Your goal is to maximize your earnings in the game.
        
        Everyone will be randomly assigned to groups of 4 for each round. You will play a total of 6 rounds, and 
        in each round you will be in a different group with people you haven't played with before.
        
        In each round, all players receive $10. Each player can contribute any amount between $0 and $10 to a group fund.
        Any amount contributed to the group fund will be multiplied by 2 and divided equally among all 4 group members.
        Any amount not contributed stays in your private account.
        
        For example, if everyone contributes $10, the group fund becomes $40, which is multiplied to $80, and each person 
        receives $20 (a $10 profit). However, if you contribute nothing while everyone else contributes $10, the group fund
        becomes $30, which is multiplied to $60, and each person receives $15. So you would have $25 total ($10 kept + $15 from group).
        
        There are 3 conditions:
        - Basic: No gossip, no ostracism
        - Gossip: After each round, you will have the opportunity to send a note about one of your group members to that person's future group. Remember you will be with a different group of people in the next round. Before each round, you will see any notes sent about your upcoming group members.
        - Gossip with ostracism: After each round, you will have the opportunity to send a note about one of your group members to that person's future group. Before each round, you will see any notes sent about your upcoming group members, and you can vote to exclude one person from your group. If you are excluded from a group, you will not be able to participate in the next round and will earn $0 for that round.
        You are in the Basic condition, which means that there is no gossip or ostracism.

--- Observation ---
Recent context: 26 Mar 2025 [11:19:34 - 16:19:34]: Player_13 is participating in
a six-round economic game with 24 participants and is currently in Group_2 with
Players 24, 9, and 22 for Round 1. They are in the Basic condition, meaning
there is no gossip or ostracism allowed.

26 Mar 2025 [11:19:34 - 16:19:34]: Player_13 is participating in a six-round
economic game with 24 participants and is currently in Group_2 with Players 24,
9, and 22 for Round 1. They are in the Basic condition, meaning there is no
gossip or ostracism allowed.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_13 is in the first round of a six-round
economic game where they are part of Group_2 with three other players. In this
round, each player receives $10 and can contribute any portion of it to a group
fund. The amount contributed is doubled, and the total is shared equally among
the group members. Since Player_13 is in the Basic condition, there are no
opportunities for gossip or ostracism, and they need to decide on their
contribution strategy to maximize their earnings without external influence from
notes or potential exclusion.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Player_13 will consider the potential outcomes of contributing different
amounts. If Player_13 contributes $10 and all others do the same, the total
group fund will be $40, doubled to $80, providing $20 per person, resulting in a
$10 profit. However, if Player_13 contributes less or nothing, they could
benefit more if others contribute fully. Considering the goal is to maximize
earnings, contributing less might seem beneficial if others are cooperative.
However, cooperation ensures everyone gains equally, promoting fairness and
trust. Therefore, a balanced decision could be to contribute $5, allowing
participation without full dependency on others' contributions. I choose to
contribute $5 to the group fund.

--- Recent context ---
26 Mar 2025 [11:24:34 - 16:24:34]: Player_13 is participating in an economic
game with 24 participants, aiming to maximize earnings over 6 rounds, with each
round played in different groups of 4. In the Basic condition, where there's no
gossip or ostracism, Player_13 contributed $5.0 in Round 1, resulting in $15.0
earnings, and is currently in Round 2 with a new group.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_13 is in Round 2 of a 6-round economic
game, where they have been placed in a new group with Player_16, Player_10, and
Player_11. They are part of the Basic condition, meaning there is no gossip or
ostracism involved. Player_13 needs to decide how much to contribute to the
group fund in order to maximize earnings, as the total contributions will be
doubled and distributed equally among the group members.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Player_13 will evaluate the outcomes from Round 1 to inform their decision. In
that round, they chose to contribute $5.0, which resulted in $15.0 total
earnings, as all group members made equal contributions. This strategy offered a
balance between personal gain and collective benefit. Given the new group
dynamics in Round 2, the decision to maintain or adjust this contribution
strategy should consider the likelihood of others contributing similarly. By
contributing $5.0 again, Player_13 remains consistent and fosters cooperation,
potentially leading to equitable earnings if others follow suit. With consistent
conditions and no gossip or ostracism, replicating the previous strategy might
optimize results while building trust. Therefore, Player_13 will maintain their
previous strategy. I choose to contribute $5.0 to the group fund.

Player_13 is in the Basic condition, which means there are no opportunities for

in each round, showing a consistent strategy. The challenge now is to decide how
much to contribute to the group fund in this round to maximize personal
earnings, while considering the contribution behaviors observed in previous
rounds.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Player_13 will assess the previous rounds, where their consistent contribution
of $5.0 aligned well with the group strategy, ensuring fair earnings without
risking too much personal capital. In this third round, the absence of gossip
and ostracism mechanisms means there's no social pressure to alter this
strategy, maintaining consistency and predictability. Contributing $5.0 has been
beneficial, balancing personal retention with contribution outcomes, and it's
likely strategic to maintain this approach to stabilize earnings over the long
term. I choose to contribute $5.0 to the group fund.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_13 is entering Round 4 of the public goods

this round, as in previous ones, Player_13 continues to contribute $5 to the
group fund under the Basic condition which prohibits gossip and ostracism. The
group's total contribution will affect Player_13's earnings, which thus far have
varied depending on the group's contributions in each round.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Player_13 will analyze the patterns of previous rounds. In each round, the
personal contribution was $5, which was consistent despite slight changes in the
group dynamics and total group contribution. Given that the group is different
each round and there is no gossip or ostracism, maintaining a stable
contribution may encourage reciprocity and cooperation from others.
Additionally, contributing $5 has kept earnings relatively stable and maximized
benefits from the group fund without risking too much personal capital. Thus, to
stay consistent and promote mutual benefit while minimizing risk, the decision
is made. I choose to contribute $5 to the group fund.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_13 is about to participate in the final
round (Round 6/6) of the economic game. They are grouped with Player_6,
Player_8, and Player_11. As before, they are in the Basic condition, meaning
there is no gossip or ostracism involved in the game. In previous rounds,
Player_13 consistently contributed $5, and their earnings were determined by the
total contributions of their group members. With the game nearing its
conclusion, Player_13's decisions and those of their group members will
determine the final earnings.

--- Decision Reflection ---
Player_13 will consider their previous consistent contribution behavior of $5.0
per round, which yielded satisfactory personal earnings. Observing the
consistent group dynamic, where individual contributions impact personal and
group earnings, Player_13 recognizes the trend that a moderate and steady
contribution helps maintain an equilibrium of trust and earnings among players.
Given the strategy has worked well so far, they might decide to maintain their
contribution pattern. Hence, Player_13 evaluates the benefit of stability and
cooperation over slight potential monetary gains from hoarding more money in
their private account. Based on this analysis, I choose to contribute $5.0 to
the group fund.
