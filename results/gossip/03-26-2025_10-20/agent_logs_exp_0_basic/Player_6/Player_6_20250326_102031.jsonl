Meanwhile, those contributing around $2.0 or even less tend to keep more, leading to higher individual earnings.

Knowing that Player_24 was relatively cooperative by contributing $3.0 last round, Tony could anticipate a similar level of contribution or slightly lower if Player_24 was disappointed by the reciprocity. Player_17 and Player_18's patterns aren't explicitly stated, but generally following a consistent personal-optimization strategy seen in Player_6's responses, Tony would predict them either matching the average or leaning towards significantly low contributions.
