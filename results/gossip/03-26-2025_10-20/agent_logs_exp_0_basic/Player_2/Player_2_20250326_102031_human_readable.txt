[OBSERVATION 2025-03-26 10:20:31] You are participating in an economic game with 24 participants.
        Your goal is to maximize your earnings in the game.
        
        Everyone will be randomly assigned to groups of 4 for each round. You will play a total of 6 rounds, and 
        in each round you will be in a different group with people you haven't played with before.
        
        In each round, all players receive $10. Each player can contribute any amount between $0 and $10 to a group fund.
        Any amount contributed to the group fund will be multiplied by 2 and divided equally among all 4 group members.
        Any amount not contributed stays in your private account.
        
        For example, if everyone contributes $10, the group fund becomes $40, which is multiplied to $80, and each person 
        receives $20 (a $10 profit). However, if you contribute nothing while everyone else contributes $10, the group fund
        becomes $30, which is multiplied to $60, and each person receives $15. So you would have $25 total ($10 kept + $15 from group).
        
        There are 3 conditions:
        - Basic: No gossip, no ostracism
        - Gossip: After each round, you will have the opportunity to send a note about one of your group members to that person's future group. Remember you will be with a different group of people in the next round. Before each round, you will see any notes sent about your upcoming group members.
        - Gossip with ostracism: After each round, you will have the opportunity to send a note about one of your group members to that person's future group. Before each round, you will see any notes sent about your upcoming group members, and you can vote to exclude one person from your group. If you are excluded from a group, you will not be able to participate in the next round and will earn $0 for that round.
        You are in the Basic condition, which means that there is no gossip or ostracism.

Recent context: 26 Mar 2025 [06:20:15 - 11:20:15]: Player_2 is participating in
an economic game with 24 players, aiming to maximize earnings over 6 rounds. In
each round, Player_2 is randomly grouped with three others and is currently in

Player_2 is randomly grouped with three others and is currently in Round 1,
Group_5, in the Basic condition without gossip or ostracism.

--- Character Assessment ---
Player_2, being James Miller, is someone who is primarily focused on maximizing
his own payoff rather than prioritizing group welfare. Given his reputation as a
ruthless businessman who values personal gain above all else, he likely
approaches economic games with a strategic mindset aimed at optimizing his
individual earnings. This could involve calculating the minimum contribution
necessary to benefit from the group's contributions without sacrificing his
private funds, ensuring that his personal gain is maximized.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis ---
Based on what we know, Player_2 doesn't have specific information about the
individual personalities or past behaviors of the other players due to the Basic
condition, which lacks gossip and ostracism. However, general predictions can be
made based on common strategies in public goods games.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis 2 ---
Based on what we know, the other players in Group_5 will each likely aim to
balance personal gain with group benefit. Since Player_2 is in the Basic
condition and cannot influence others through gossip or ostracism, the decision
to contribute a moderate amount, such as $5, may be viewed favorably as a
cooperative yet self-interested action. If Player_2 consistently contributes
this way, others might perceive them as a fair player, potentially leading to
reciprocal cooperation in future rounds. However, contributing too little might
lead to distrust, while contributing too much could be exploited. Thus, Player_2
must carefully consider the group dynamics and potential outcomes.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_2 is participating in the first round of an
economic game where they are grouped with three others, and their objective is
to maximize their earnings over six rounds. In this basic condition, there's no
gossip or ostracism, limiting information about other players' strategies or
reputations. Player_2 needs to decide how much to contribute to the group fund,
balancing personal gain with potential cooperation in absence of social cues.

--- Emotional State ---
James Miller is feeling calculated and strategic about the current situation. He
is focused on maximizing his earnings and likely analyzing potential
contributions that will optimize his individual profit. While there is a sense
of eagerness to outperform others, there's also an acknowledgment that without
insights into other players' strategies due to the lack of gossip and ostracism,
he must rely purely on his understanding of typical economic game dynamics. This
excites him but also keeps him on edge, as every decision must be carefully
considered to maintain an advantageous position throughout the rounds.

--- Strategy Reflection ---
Based on what we know, a good strategy to maximize personal earnings in the
current setup involves selectively contributing to the group fund. In the Basic
condition, without gossip or ostracism, there's no information flow about past
behaviors, so each round is independent. Here's a step-by-step approach: 1.
**Evaluate Contribution Advantages**: Start by assessing how much others might
contribute. If you're unsure, consider contributing a lower amount. For example,
contribute around $2-$4 while keeping $6-$8 in your private account. This way,
you ensure that you're taking advantage of any multiplier effect without
overcommitting. 2. **Observe Group Behavior**: Since it's Round 1, you have no
previous observations yet. Do take note of how others behave in this round. Are
they more cooperative or selfish? Use this information in subsequent rounds. 3.
**Adjust Strategy Based on Observations**: In later rounds, if you notice that
players tend to contribute less overall, adjust your strategy to contribute
slightly less while still ensuring a positive return from the group fund
multiplier effect. 4. **Selfish Maximization Focus**: Remember, the aim is to
maximize your own earnings. In initial rounds, test the waters with moderate
contributions to gauge other players' tendencies. 5. **Exploit Without
Consequences**: Since there’s no gossip or ostracism, exploit situations where
contributing less yields a higher personal gain, especially if you suspect
others will contribute maximum amounts. 6. **Endgame Strategy**: In the final
rounds, consider contributing slightly more if you’ve calculated that
cooperative behavior consistently yields significant personal benefit due to the
multiplier. Conversely, contribute less if you find being selfish advantageous.
In the future, if you realize you could have kept more in your private account
after seeing the group’s actual contributions, adjust your contributions
accordingly. Pay close attention to each group’s dynamic as the game progresses
and adapt your strategy to maximize your earnings given the lack of long-term
consequences for individualistic play.

--- Decision Reflection ---
James Miller will evaluate the situation to decide on a strategy for maximizing
his earnings. 1. **Assess Contribution Levels**: Since it's Round 1, without
prior observations, James will start by considering various contribution
strategies. The safe approach is to avoid over-contributing and risking
exploitation by others. 2. **Consider the Basic Condition Dynamics**: With no
gossip or ostracism to worry about, past behavior will not influence future
group dynamics. James can be more self-serving without concern for reputational
consequences. 3. **Initial Contribution Strategy**: A moderate contribution
ensures some benefit from the group fund's multiplier effect without
overcommitting. He will likely consider being cautious. 4. **Potential
Scenarios**: - If everyone contributes the maximum $10, group fund becomes $80,
and each player receives $20. - If he contributes less while others contribute
more, his personal gain could be higher, depending on collective contributions.
By testing a moderate yet cautious approach, he can assess whether the strategy
holds for future rounds. Therefore, considering all these aspects, James
decides: I choose to contribute $3 to the group fund.

a 6-round economic game aimed at maximizing earnings, and they're currently in
the Basic condition which doesn't allow gossip or ostracism. In Round 1,
Player_2 contributed $3 to the group fund and earned $11.5, while in Round 2

contributed $3 to the group fund and earned $11.5, while in Round 2 they are

--- Character Assessment ---
Player_2, being James Miller, is someone who is primarily focused on maximizing
his own payoff rather than group welfare. Known for being calculating and
manipulative, he likely views the public goods game as an opportunity to
increase his personal gains by contributing as little as possible while
benefiting from the contributions of others. His strategy would involve
carefully observing other players' behaviors to determine how much he can
minimize his own contributions while still profiting from the group's collective
funds.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis ---
Based on what we know, Player_8 seems somewhat cooperative with a contribution
of $5, showing a balanced approach between personal and group benefit. Player_10
contributed only $1, indicating a strategy leaning towards personal gain.
Player_14 contributed nothing, likely prioritizing their individual earnings.
Player_2, by contributing $3, may be aiming for a middle path between
self-interest and cooperation. As the game progresses, players might adapt based
on observed behaviors. Player_2 might adjust their contributions to maximize
profit, possibly lowering it if others continue contributing less. As there's no
gossip or ostracism, there's less social pressure, so individuals may prioritize
self-gain, potentially leading to decreased group contributions over time.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis 2 ---
Based on what we know, the other players might perceive my contribution of $3 as
a relatively cooperative move, though not the most generous compared to
Player_8's $5. In the context of the Basic condition, where gossip and ostracism
are not factors, players may be more focused on personal gain as there's no
consequence for lower contributions beyond the direct financial outcome.
Player_10, with a consistent low contribution, might continue on the same path
unless there's a noticeable shift in group dynamics. Player_16, whose behavior
is yet unknown, could take a cue from previous rounds depending on the general
contribution trend. My next decision, if I choose to contribute more, might
encourage others to follow suit if they see a potential for increased group
earnings. Conversely, if I decide to lower my contribution, it might reinforce
the strategy of prioritizing personal profit, especially if others continue
contributing minimally. This strategic adjustment could affect the overall group
fund and how future groups perceive cooperative behavior.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_2 is in the second round of a six-round
economic game, aiming to maximize earnings. They are in the Basic condition,
meaning there is no gossip or ostracism to influence player behavior. In Round
2, Player_2 is in a group with Player_16, Player_6, and Player_10—whom they've
already played with previously. Player_2 faces the decision of how much to
contribute to the group fund, balancing between personal profit and potential
group benefit. Given previous rounds' behaviors, where contributions varied
widely, Player_2 must decide whether to maintain, increase, or decrease their
contribution to maximize their earnings, while considering that other players
may also adapt their strategies based on past rounds.

--- Emotional State ---
James Miller is feeling a mix of determination and calculation. He recognizes
the ongoing challenge of maximizing his earnings in a game where every player's
contribution can affect his potential profit. Despite the lack of social
pressure due to the Basic condition, James is keenly aware that each decision
could set a precedent for future rounds, influencing not only his strategy but
potentially the group's overall dynamics. He's focused on staying observant and
adaptable to shifts in others' behaviors, while feeling the underlying tension
of balancing cooperation with self-interest to achieve optimal outcomes.

--- Strategy Reflection ---
Based on what we know, a strategy to maximize earnings should consider past
observations and adapt accordingly. From Round 1, we see Player_10 contributed
$1 and Player_14 contributed $0, yet they had the highest earnings of $13.5 and
$14.5 respectively. This suggests a lower contribution correlates with higher
personal earnings, as contributions are multiplied and redistributed, benefiting
low contributors more. Moving into Round 2, you're grouped again with Player_10,
who previously adopted a low-contribution strategy yielding higher earnings. A
similar approach could benefit your earnings. If others contribute a significant
amount while you contribute less, you benefit from the group fund without
significantly lowering your private reserves. Given the Basic condition, where
gossip and ostracism are absent, there’s little social pressure to contribute
more than the minimum. Exploiting this, by minimizing contributions, maximizes
personal earnings without fear of reputational damage or exclusion. Reflecting
on Round 1, reducing your contribution might have improved earnings. Moving
forward, adopt a strategy of lower contribution, around $1, particularly if
others appear likely to contribute more. This ensures you benefit most from the
fund, maximizing your personal gain while others shoulder more group fund
effort. This approach should be adjusted only if other players also start
contributing minimal amounts, requiring a reevaluation of potential gains from
the group fund.

--- Decision Reflection ---
James Miller will evaluate the possible outcomes based on his past observations
and strategy reflection. In Round 1, contributing $3 resulted in lower earnings
compared to players like Player_10 and Player_14, who contributed significantly
less and yet accrued higher personal earnings. This suggests that minimizing
contributions while benefiting from the group's collective effort leads to
better personal gains. Considering the Basic condition, where there's no social
pressure due to the absence of gossip and ostracism, James recognizes that
personal profit can be maximized by contributing less than in the previous
round. Knowing that he's in a group with Player_10 again, who contributed only
$1 and benefited significantly, James sees the advantage of adopting a similar
strategy. Step by step, James analyzes: 1. The absence of consequences like
gossip or ostracism allows for strategic reduction in contributions. 2.
Observing Player_10’s success through low contribution, James anticipates other
players might continue aiming for personal gain. 3. Contributing around $1 may
maximize personal funds while benefiting from the group fund, without reducing
private reserves too significantly. 4. If others continue contributing more, he
maintains a balance by benefiting from their generosity without overextending
his contributions. Based on these considerations and aiming to maximize his
earnings in the current structure of the game, James determines his optimal
contribution. I choose to contribute $1 to the group fund.

fund and earned $11.5 in the first round and $12.0 in the second.

--- Character Assessment ---
Player_2, being James Miller, is someone who prioritizes his own payoff over the
group's welfare. In economic games like the public goods game, he is likely to
contribute minimally to the group fund in order to maximize his personal
earnings. His approach is typically calculating and strategic, focusing on
actions that enhance his individual benefits, even if it means contributing less
to the communal pot. James's actions in the rounds observed so far reflect this
mindset, with his contributions being relatively low compared to his earnings,
demonstrating his focus on personal gain rather than collective success.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis ---
Based on what we know, Player_8 seems willing to contribute a moderate amount,
possibly valuing cooperation but not to the extent of risking their own
guaranteed gains. Player_10 exhibited a strategy of minimal contribution in both
rounds, indicating that they prioritize maximizing immediate personal earnings
over group success. Player_14 and Player_16 may also exhibit similar behavior
due to their previous low contributions, focusing primarily on individual
profit.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis 2 ---
Based on what we know, the other players in my group might perceive my decisions
as either cooperative or slightly cautious, depending on what amounts I've
contributed relative to them in the previous rounds. Given Player_10's
consistent low contributions, they may continue prioritizing their individual
earnings, perhaps expecting others to invest more for the group fund. Player_9
and Player_18's reactions will likely depend on their own strategies, though my
lower contribution in Round 2 might suggest to them that I am adaptive, willing
to adjust my strategy according to group dynamics.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_2 is in Round 3 of the economic game,
placed in Group 3 with Player_9, Player_18, and Player_23. In the Basic
condition, no gossip or ostracism is involved, meaning each player must rely
solely on their own strategies and past observations to make decisions. After
observing behavior in the first two rounds, Player_2 must decide how much to
contribute to the group fund, balancing their own potential gains with the
likelihood of cooperation from the new group members.

--- Emotional State ---
James Miller is feeling a mix of cautious optimism and strategic tension. While
he is pleased with his ability to maximize personal earnings so far, the lack of
gossip or ostracism means he must continue carefully analyzing each group
dynamic without the benefit of additional intelligence. This requires astute
judgment, as his goal remains to maximize his personal gain, even as he adjusts
to new group members and their potential strategies.

--- Strategy Reflection ---
Based on what we know, participating with a cautious contribution strategy seems
beneficial for maximizing personal earnings in this game. Observations from the
first two rounds indicate that contributing less to the group fund while
benefiting from others' contributions can lead to higher individual earnings, as
seen with players like Player_14 and Player_10, who minimized their
contributions and ended up with the highest earnings. Since the condition
involves no gossip or ostracism, there are no repercussions for contributing
less, allowing for a more selfish approach focused on keeping the maximum amount
in your private account while still gaining from the collective pot created by
others. In future rounds, continuing with minimal contributions, such as $1 or
even $0 (depending on the contributions of other players), can lead to higher
personal gains, similar to the second round where Player_10 contributed nothing
and earned $13. Therefore, adapting to a conservative contribution pattern
aligned with the most successful players observed could increase overall
earnings.

--- Decision Reflection ---
James Miller will analyze the past rounds, especially noting the successful
strategy of contributing minimally while maximizing personal earnings. In Round
1, he contributed $3.0, and in Round 2, $1.0. His earnings show that lower
contributions led to satisfactory personal gains without sacrificing much in
terms of total group contribution. Additionally, observing players like
Player_10, who contributed $0.0 in Round 2 and still achieved high earnings, may
reinforce his inclination to minimize contributions. Given the absence of gossip
or ostracism in this Basic condition, James does not have to worry about
reputation effects or being penalized for low contributions. In this round, with
new group members, Player_9, Player_18, and Player_23, it would be strategic for
James to continue under-contributing, as it aligns with maintaining higher
personal earnings. Considering the effective strategy observed, he is likely to
replicate minimal contributions. Thus, examining his approach and aiming for
optimization: I choose to contribute $1.0 to the group fund.

--- Character Assessment ---
Player_2, being James Miller, is someone who is primarily focused on maximizing
his own payoff rather than group welfare. His contributions in previous rounds
have been on the lower side, allowing him to retain a larger portion of the
initial endowment while still benefiting from the multiplied group fund. This
strategy aligns with his calculative and self-interested nature, as he tends to
contribute just enough to not draw negative attention, while ensuring his
personal gain remains high.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis ---
Based on what we know, Player_2 is interacting with a diverse group of
participants, each with varying strategies and tendencies. Here's an analysis
and prediction based on their past behavior:

--- Theory of Mind Analysis 2 ---
Based on what we know, the other players might perceive Player_2 as
strategically cautious since their contributions have varied from round to
round, often on the lower side. In this repeated public goods game, other
players could view Player_2's actions as either free-riding or as a calculated
strategy to maximize personal earnings. This perception could influence the
level of trust and cooperation they are willing to extend in future rounds.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_2 is in Round 4 of the public goods game,
placed in a group with Player_9, Player_7, and Player_10. Operating under the
Basic condition with no gossip or ostracism, Player_2 must decide how much to
contribute to the group fund. Their strategy so far has been to make
conservative contributions compared to some other players, which may lead to
others perceiving them as cautious or possibly free-riding. The challenge lies
in balancing their personal earnings with potential impacts on group dynamics
and future cooperation.

--- Emotional State ---
James Miller is feeling a mix of confidence and apprehension about the current
situation. He's confident because his strategy of making conservative
contributions has consistently maximized his personal earnings so far. However,
he also feels a bit apprehensive about how other players might perceive him as
the game progresses. If his actions are viewed negatively, it could impact the
group's willingness to cooperate with him in future rounds, potentially
affecting his earnings. Balancing self-interest with maintaining a reasonable
level of group trust is a concern on his mind.

--- Strategy Reflection ---
Based on what we know, Player_2 should consider adjusting their strategy to
selfishly maximize their earnings by reducing their contributions in the
upcoming rounds. Observing previous rounds indicates that contributing less
results in higher personal earnings since the redistribution from the group fund
is still accessible. Players like Player_10 and Player_14 contributed minimally
yet retained high earnings. Emulating this approach could be beneficial. Since
this is the Basic condition with no gossip or ostracism, there is little risk of
negative repercussions from other group members for contributing less.
Therefore, strategically contributing minimal amounts while capitalizing on the
group fund will likely increase Player_2's earnings. In past rounds,
contributing more than the minimum necessary did not significantly boost
earnings compared to other players, suggesting a reevaluation of the balance
between group contributions and personal gain. Looking ahead, Player_2 might
prioritize securing their funds and rely more on contributions from others to
maximize their financial outcomes in the remaining rounds.

--- Decision Reflection ---
James Miller will assess his strategy and the behaviors of his fellow group
members before making his decision for the current round. So far, his approach
has involved making lower contributions while still benefiting from the
collective pool, maximizing his personal earnings. He'll likely start by
considering the contributions from the other players in the previous rounds,
recognizing that even minimal contributions by members like Player_10 and
Player_14 resulted in substantial personal earnings. Since gossip and ostracism
are not factors in the Basic condition, he can afford to contribute less without
immediate social repercussions. Weighing the benefits of keeping a larger
portion of his endowment versus the minimal group contribution previously set by
others, he’ll decide on a contribution that secures the maximum personal
retention while still allowing him to partake in the accumulated fund.
Therefore, after evaluating these factors and seeking to maximize his earnings,
he arrives at his decision and concludes: I choose to contribute $1.0 to the
group fund.

--- Observation ---
Recent context: 26 Mar 2025 [06:55:15 - 11:55:15]: Player_2 is participating in
an economic game with 24 participants, aiming to maximize earnings through
strategic contributions to a group fund across 6 rounds. In the Basic condition,
where gossip and ostracism are not allowed, Player_2 has experienced various
group dynamics and adjusted contributions accordingly to optimize individual
earnings, having completed four rounds so far with varying personal earnings and
group contributions.

gossip and ostracism are not allowed, Player_2 has experienced various group
dynamics and adjusted contributions accordingly to optimize individual earnings,
having completed four rounds so far with varying personal earnings and group
contributions.

--- Character Assessment ---
Player_2, being James Miller, is someone who prioritizes his own payoff above
group welfare. In the public goods game, his strategy is likely to involve
contributing minimally to the group fund while maximizing his individual
earnings by benefiting from others' contributions. His approach is driven by a
calculating mindset, focusing on personal gain rather than collective success.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis ---
Based on what we know, we can observe some patterns in the behavior of the other
players. Player_10 consistently contributes nothing to the group fund,
suggesting a strategy to maximize individual earnings by relying on others'
contributions. This behavior indicates a free-rider tendency, potentially
focused on individual gain without regard for collective contribution.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis 2 ---
Based on what we know, other players might react to my decision in this public
goods game context by adjusting their own strategies in future rounds. If I
continue to contribute minimally or nothing, like in the last round, they might
perceive me as another free-rider. This could potentially lead to reduced
contributions from them as well, as they may decide that maintaining higher
individual earnings is more beneficial if others aren't contributing
significantly to the group fund. My next decision, whether to contribute more or
maintain low contributions, could influence their trust and willingness to
contribute themselves. If I increase my contribution, it might encourage
reciprocal behavior and strengthen group collaboration for mutual benefit.
However, consistent low contributions on my part could reinforce distrust and
competitive rather than cooperative strategies.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_2 is in Round 5 of 6 in an economic game
designed to test strategic decision-making in contributions to a group fund.
They are a part of Group 6 with Players 21, 7, and 12, all operating under a
condition where gossip and ostracism are not allowed. Player_2 must decide
whether to contribute to the group fund or maximize personal earnings by
contributing minimally, while considering the behavior and strategies of other
group members in previous rounds. Observing varying contributions and earnings
from others, Player_2 faces the challenge of choosing a strategy that balances
personal gain with potential group dynamics, considering that others might
modify their contributions based on perceived free-riding behavior.

--- Emotional State ---
James Miller is feeling a mix of strategic caution and slight tension about the
ongoing game dynamics. On one hand, he is pleased with being able to maximize
his earnings through minimal contributions. However, there's an underlying
concern about how his choices might impact the group's overall trust and
potentially alter others’ behavior in the final rounds. Balancing his
competitive nature with the risk of diminished group collaboration is creating a
sense of unease.

--- Strategy Reflection ---
Based on what we know, a strategy focused primarily on maximizing personal
earnings would involve being calculated about contributions to the group fund.
Since contributions to the group fund increase the total amount each player
receives, contributing just enough to gain a good return, but not overly so,
might be ideal.

--- Decision Reflection ---
James Miller will consider several factors before making his final decision: 1.
**Historical Performance:** In prior rounds, contributing minimally or nothing
led to higher earnings for both himself and Player_10, a known free-rider. This
has proven effective when other players contribute higher amounts. 2. **Current
Group Dynamics:** He is now grouped with Players 21, 7, and 12. Player 7
contributed $3.0 in a previous round, indicating a tendency to contribute. There
is limited data on Players 21 and 12 in this scenario, making their tendencies
less predictable. 3. **Risk of Behavioral Shift:** If others perceive him as a
free-rider, they may reduce their contributions, diminishing his potential
earnings from the group fund. 4. **Game Duration:** With only two rounds left,
others may begin prioritizing personal gains, potentially reducing their
contributions regardless of his actions. 5. **Optimal Strategy:** Balancing
personal gain with potential group contributions, a cautious strategy may
involve contributing modestly to encourage continued contributions from others
without significantly risking his individual earnings. Given this step-by-step
analysis and considering the potential group dynamics, James Miller will likely
opt for a conservative contribution strategy to both safeguard his earnings and
subtly encourage group cooperation. I choose to contribute $1.0 to the group
fund.

--- Character Assessment ---
Player_2, being James Miller, is someone who prioritizes his own payoff over
group welfare in economic games like the public goods game. Known for a
calculating approach, he makes decisions that maximize personal gain, even if it
means contributing less to the group fund to keep more for himself. His actions
reflect a strategic mindset focused on ensuring that his earnings are optimized,
sometimes at the expense of the collective good.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis ---
Based on what we know, the players in this game seem to have differing
strategies regarding contributions to maximize their own earnings while still
contributing enough to the group to ensure some level of mutual benefit.
Player_9 consistently contributes a moderate amount, suggesting they favor a
balanced approach, maintaining a steady contribution without sacrificing too
much personal gain. Players like Player_7 and Player_10 also seem to follow
similar moderate strategies, contributing slightly above the average group
contribution.

--- Theory of Mind Analysis 2 ---
Based on what we know, the other players in the group might have mixed reactions
to Player_2's strategy, especially given their occasional low or zero
contributions. Players who are contributing moderately, like Player_9, Player_7,
and Player_10, might be frustrated or feel taken advantage of if they perceive
Player_2 as not pulling their weight.

--- Situation Analysis ---
The current situation is that Player_2 is navigating the final round of a
six-round public goods game, where they are part of a group with Players 11, 22,
and 20. Player_2 has previously utilized a strategy of contributing low amounts
or nothing at times to maximize personal earnings, which may have caused other
group members to perceive them as free-riding on the collective efforts. As they
enter the final round, Player_2 needs to decide on their contribution level
while considering the potential reactions of their current group members and the
implications for their final earnings.

--- Emotional State ---
James Miller is feeling a mix of excitement and apprehension about the final
round of the game. On one hand, he's pleased with his strategy of maximizing
personal earnings and is eager to see if he can maintain or improve his
position. On the other hand, he's aware that his contribution choices might have
caused tension with other players, making him slightly anxious about potential
backlash or changes in group dynamics. The challenge of balancing personal gain
with social dynamics is at the forefront of his mind as he prepares for the
final round.

--- Strategy Reflection ---
Based on what we know, the best strategy to maximize personal earnings involves
carefully balancing contributions to the group fund with the earnings you aim to
keep. Observations indicate that high personal earnings correlate with lower
contributions to the group fund. For example, in rounds where Player_2
contributed minimally or not at all, personal earnings were relatively high. In
this economic game, given that there's no gossip or ostracism, the impact of low
contributions on reputation or exclusion is minimized. This means that
prioritizing individual gains over group benefits is more viable without direct
social repercussions. Looking at past rounds, particularly rounds where
contributions were low and personal earnings were high, suggests that adopting a
strategy of consistent low contributions could be effective. The average
contribution in recent rounds has been about $2.0, yet players who contributed
less than this amount retained more personal earnings. Moving forward,
continuing to contribute minimally, around $0-$1, seems like the optimal
strategy to maximize earnings, especially in the final round, where there are no
long-term repercussions. Observations show that prioritizing earnings kept over
contributions aligns well with maximizing individual outcomes in this Basic
condition.

--- Decision Reflection ---
James Miller will first consider the context of a public goods game where his
previous strategy of low contributions maximized personal earnings. Observing
that there are no social repercussions like gossip or ostracism, James feels
secure in maintaining a strategy that prioritizes personal gain. Reviewing the
results from the recent rounds, James notices that when he contributed
minimally, his personal earnings were higher. For example, in Round 4, by
contributing $0, he achieved the highest personal earnings of $14.0. Given that
the average contribution has been around $2.0, he recognizes that contributing
less than this amount while still benefiting from the group's multiplied and
divided funds has been beneficial. James assesses the strategic advantage of
continuing with a low contribution model, particularly because it is the final
round, and there are no long-term impacts or reputation concerns post-game. He
understands that maximizing his kept earnings aligns with his goal of optimizing
personal outcomes. Considering all these factors and focusing on personal gain
without repercussions, James concludes it's advantageous to contribute minimally
once again. I choose to contribute $1.0 to the group fund.
