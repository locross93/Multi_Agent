Throughout the game, they encountered opportunities for gossip and ostracism, allowing them to influence group dynamics by noting other players' behaviors and potentially impacting their inclusion in future rounds.", "", "Character Assessment: Player_20, being Boris Ivanov, is someone who approaches economic games like the public goods game with a strategic mindset, balancing both personal gains and group welfare. As a chess club owner and someone who values intellectual challenges, Boris likely looks for an optimal strategy that not only enhances his own payoff but also supports the group dynamic. His patient nature would lead him to consistently observe group patterns and adjust his contributions to maintain cooperation and maximize overall outcomes.", "", "Theory of Mind Analysis: Based on what we know, Player_2 seems to maintain a consistent contribution in line with Player_20, which suggests a steady and cooperative approach. This player may continue to contribute moderately to uphold group harmony and personal gain.", "", "Theory of Mind Analysis 2: Based on what we know, the other players might view my consistent but moderate contributions as relatively neutral or slightly favorable, as they align reasonably with group averages without appearing overly self-serving. Given that gossip plays a significant role, my decisions to write or not write notes about others could influence my peers' perceptions and trust. If I choose to advocate for cooperative behaviors while fairly assessing contributions, it might foster goodwill, making others perceive me as a fair player. However, selectively highlighting individuals\u2019 shortcomings, especially if I vote for exclusion, might lead to some players viewing me as strategic or self-interested, potentially affecting their future cooperation with me. Balancing fair assessments with strategic choices could encourage overall group performance, but there's a risk of being seen as calculating, which might impact future interactions.", "", "Situation Analysis: The current situation is that Player_20 is participating in the final round of a public goods game, where they must decide on their contribution amount in a new group, consisting of Player_2, Player_12, and Player_9. They are in a \"Gossip with ostracism\" condition, which allows players to send anonymous notes about others' contributions to their future groups. Player_20 has received multiple notes about Player_12, highlighting their tendency to contribute less than average, suggesting they prioritize personal gains over group success. Player_20 must now decide whether to vote to exclude a group member before the round begins, considering the impact of gossip and group dynamics on their decision. Balancing strategic decisions with fair play is crucial, as it affects their earnings and how others perceive and cooperate with them.", "", "Emotional State: Boris Ivanov would consider the worst possible outcome to be exclusion from the group, resulting in earning $0 for the round. This would likely make him feel frustrated, as his strategic approach to balancing group welfare and personal gain wouldn't lead to the desired outcome. Considering his risk-averse nature, Boris would likely aim to avoid this by voting strategically, possibly choosing to exclude a member like Player_12, who has consistently lower contributions according to the gossip received. By aligning his decision with group averages and aiming to maintain cooperation, Boris would strive to mitigate personal risk and enhance group dynamics.", "", "Strategy Reflection: Based on what we know, it's important to focus on optimizing personal gains while maintaining enough cooperation to avoid ostracism. Since it's the final round, the incentive to be cooperative is lower, but avoiding exclusion is still crucial. ", "", "To maximize long-term earnings:", "1. **Analyze Past Behaviors**: In previous rounds, you contributed $6.5, close to the group average, which kept you from being perceived as too selfish. Maintaining or slightly increasing this contribution can help balance risk and reward.", "   ", "2. **Observe and Adapt**: Gossip notes highlight players contributing below average, often resulting in their exclusion. By ensuring contributions align with or slightly surpass the average, you minimize the risk of negative gossip and potential exclusion.", "", "3. **Learn from Successful Players**: Player_10 and Player_7 have maintained moderate to above-average contributions, sustaining good earnings while not being targeted for exclusion. Emulating such strategies might prove beneficial.", "", "4. **Adjust for Final Round Dynamics**: Considering this is the last round, and the game includes opportunities for gossip and ostracism, align your contribution to match or slightly exceed the average for this round. This strategy diminishes the chance of being the target of gossip, thus securing your participation and earnings.", "", "5. **Reflect and Plan**: In previous rounds, slightly higher contributions might have leveraged better collective earnings while reinforcing trust, minimizing the risk of exclusion. In future games, consistently engage just above average to maintain a balance between personal and collective benefits.", "", "By tactically contributing slightly above the perceived average in this last round, you can best safeguard against exclusion threats while ensuring solid personal earnings.", "", "Decision Reflection: Boris Ivanov will consider the following steps to make his decision:", "", "1. **Objective Analysis**: Boris knows the importance of avoiding exclusion and maximizing both personal and group earnings. The gossip notes suggest that others evaluate contributions relative to the group average.", "", "2. **Review Past Contributions**: In the previous round, Boris contributed $6.5, slightly below the group average of $6.9. Thus, maintaining or slightly increasing this amount can help avoid being targeted for exclusion.", "", "3. **Gossip and Ostracism Dynamics**: He understands that players contributing below average are targeted in gossip, reducing their likelihood of future inclusion. This emphasizes the importance of aligning with or surpassing group expectations.", "", "4. **Endgame Strategy**: Since it\u2019s the final round, there\u2019s less motivation for others to be cooperative, potentially increasing selfish behaviors. To counteract this, Boris will aim to contribute enough to maintain a non-selfish image and secure future earnings.", "", "5. **Balancing Risk and Reward**: By contributing just above the previous average, Boris minimizes the risk of exclusion while protecting his personal earnings.

How much money you will contribute to the group fund (any amount between $0 and $10.0)? The group fund will be multiplied by 2.0 and divided equally among all players.
