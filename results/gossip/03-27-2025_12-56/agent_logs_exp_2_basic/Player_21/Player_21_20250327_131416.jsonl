Observing previous rounds, the most successful players have typically kept higher amounts for themselves, contributing minimally to the group fund.

Noticing that minimal contributions have still resulted in satisfactory earnings due to group fund payouts, he recognizes the advantage of keeping contributions low. Observing that in Round 3, contributing $1.0 was consistent with maintaining a decent payoff without significantly impacting group dynamics, he strategizes similarly for the upcoming round. Ethan's main concern is ensuring his personal earnings remain high while the group's contributions are sufficient to sustain a reasonable payout from the fund. Therefore, he decides to follow a cautious but strategic approach by contributing slightly less than before to test the group's reaction.", "", "In conclusion, Ethan will balance his competitive nature with a desire for effective group outcomes.
