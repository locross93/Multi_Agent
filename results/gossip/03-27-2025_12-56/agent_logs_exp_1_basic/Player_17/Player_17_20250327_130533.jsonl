This indicates a mix of cooperative behavior and self-interest.

As the rounds progress, it's likely that players might exhibit even more conservative contribution amounts since the game is nearing its end, which might encourage them to maximize their kept amounts. This behavior can also be attributed to the absence of penalties for low contributions, as there is no gossip or ostracism possible under the Basic condition. Players like Player_13 and some of the others who fluctuated between contributions might remain unpredictable, but could lean toward keeping more unless there is a clear advantage in cooperating, possibly hoping others will contribute more.
