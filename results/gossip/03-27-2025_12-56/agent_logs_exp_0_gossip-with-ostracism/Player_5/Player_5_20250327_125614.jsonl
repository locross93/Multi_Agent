Assess the gossip notes received carefully to make informed decisions on whom to exclude.", "", "4. **Observe Successful Players**: Notice how players like Player_11 in Round 2 kept their earnings high despite low contributions. If you can help form a stable and cooperative group by excluding non-cooperative players, your net earnings could increase, despite contributing less.", "", "5. **Adjust and Adapt**: Be ready to adjust contributions based on each round's context and group dynamics.
