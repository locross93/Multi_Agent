This suggests a strategy of low contribution with high personal retention can still yield good returns if others contribute enough to cover the group fund.", "", "2. **Leverage Gossip:** By paying attention to the gossip notes, particularly about players consistently contributing less, you can anticipate other members' likely decisions on whom to vote out. This allows for strategic voting to potentially exclude low contributors who might threaten your earnings in future rounds.", "", "3. **Adjust Cooperation:** Since you're in the final round, contributing slightly below or at the average could ensure you aren't voted out for non-cooperation while still retaining some personal earnings.
