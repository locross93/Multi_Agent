However, in Round 3, a higher contribution of $6.5 didn't yield higher earnings due to the lower contributions from other members.", "", "2. **Observe Group Behavior:** Higher contributions from other players have sometimes resulted in lower personal earnings. For instance, Player_5 in Round 2 and Player_22 in Round 3 benefited more by contributing less. This suggests a more conservative approach might be beneficial.", "", "3. **Strategy Adjustment:** As rounds progress and the condition remains without social sanctions, Player_24 could consider reducing contributions to slightly below average.
