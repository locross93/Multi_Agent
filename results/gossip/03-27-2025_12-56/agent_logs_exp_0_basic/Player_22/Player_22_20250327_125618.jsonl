Player_5 initially did not contribute at all, which suggests a free-riding strategy that could continue unless they see significant group pressure or a shift in contributions from others. Player_14 and Player_24 seem to vary more, with Player_24 making a larger contribution in Round 3. This suggests that they might strategically adjust their contributions based on group dynamics, monitoring others' behavior closely in each round.

Observing other players like Player_5, who maximized their own earnings by keeping contributions low and relying on others, serves as a useful example.
