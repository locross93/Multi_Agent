Given his background as a professional poker player, Victor is accustomed to reading the intentions of others and strategically deciding when it is advantageous to cooperate and when to prioritize his own gains. In the public goods game, Victor tends to contribute minimally to the group fund, ensuring that he benefits from the group contributions while retaining most of his own allotment. This approach aligns with his strategic and occasionally deceptive nature, favoring situations where he can maximize his personal earnings over collective welfare.", "", "Theory of Mind Analysis 2: Based on what we know, the other players might perceive Player_2's contributions as relatively cautious, aiming to balance between personal gains and group expectations. Since Player_2's contributions have generally been below the average group contribution, other players might view Player_2 as strategically self-interested. This perception might lead them to adjust their own contributions in future rounds, either by reducing their contributions to maximize their own earnings or by contributing more to maintain a stable group fund. In the final round, Player_2's decision could influence immediate group behavior; a higher contribution might encourage others to do the same, promoting a sense of trust, whereas a lower contribution could provoke others to also limit their contributions, focusing on personal gain.", "", "Situation Analysis: The current situation is that Player_2 is in the sixth and final round of the public goods game, facing a decision on how much to contribute to the group fund while in Group_2 with Player_18, Player_24, and Player_8. Throughout the game, Player_2 has been making cautious contributions that are typically below the group's average, suggesting a strategy focused on balancing personal earnings with contributing enough to not completely harm the group's fund. In this basic condition with no gossip or ostracism, Player_2 now must decide whether to maintain this cautious strategy or alter their contribution in the final round, considering the potential reactions and adjustments from other players based on previous behaviors.", "", "Decision Reflection: Victor Zhao will first evaluate the strategic benefits of contributing varying amounts to the group fund. Given his propensity to maximize personal earnings, he will weigh the potential payout from the group fund against the certainty of keeping his contribution.", "", "1. **Understand Group Dynamics:** In Round 6, Victor is playing with a new set of players, which may lack established trust or expectations. He understands that the final round might prompt others to act more selfishly.", "", "2. **Historical Performance Analysis:** Analyzing past rounds, Victor notices that while his previous contributions were below average, he still managed to earn more or close to average earnings, suggesting that minimizing contributions hasn't hurt his overall payoff.", "", "3. **Calculate Payoffs:**", "   - **If $0 Contributed:** Keep $10, receive only from the group fund; potential earnings from group fund depend on other players' contributions.", "   - **If $5 Contributed:** Keep $5, with potentially increased payout from group fund; less risk if others contribute low amounts.", "   - **If $10 Contributed:** High risk, as he fully depends on others to contribute, diminishing personal control over guaranteed earnings.", "", "4. **Anticipate Other Players' Behavior:** Assuming others are aware of the end-game scenario, they might also contribute less to secure personal payoffs. This suggests that a minimal contribution could be optimal.", "", "5. **Ensure Personal Gain:** Given Victor's strategic nature, he is likely to lean towards a conservative strategy in the final round to lock in personal earnings.", "", "Final Decision: Based on the strategic assessment to maximize his earnings while anticipating other players' likely reduced contributions, I choose to contribute $2.0 to the group fund.", "", "Exercise: As Player_2, you have $10.0 to allocate in the public goods game.
