Throughout 6 rounds, Player_24 strategically contributed small amounts to the group fund, maintaining higher personal earnings by benefiting from the collective contributions of the group members.", "", "Character Assessment: Player_24, being Karen White, is someone who is likely focused on maximizing her own payoff rather than group welfare. Given her assertive and self-interested nature, coupled with the belief that nice people finish last, Karen is inclined to contribute minimally to the group fund to ensure she retains as much of her initial amount as possible while still benefiting from others' contributions. This approach aligns with her strategic focus on winning and personal success.", "", "Theory of Mind Analysis 2: Based on what we know, the other players might feel frustrated or perceive Player_24's behavior as free-riding, as they are consistently contributing less while enjoying the benefits of the group fund. This could lead to a decrease in cooperation or trust from other players in future rounds, even though direct consequences like gossip or ostracism are not possible in the Basic condition. If Player_24 continues to contribute minimal amounts, it could potentially lead other players to reduce their own contributions as well, aiming to protect their earnings, resulting in lower total group contributions.", "", "Situation Analysis: The current situation is that Player_24 is navigating a strategic challenge in the public goods game. Despite the absence of gossip or ostracism due to the Basic condition, their pattern of minimal contributions while benefiting from the collective pool may lead to mounting frustration among other participants. As a result, this could undermine group cooperation and decrease trust, potentially influencing other players to also reduce their contributions to protect their earnings, impacting overall group outcomes and dynamics.", "", "Decision Reflection: Karen White will likely follow her established strategy of contributing minimally to maximize her personal earnings.

In previous rounds, she consistently contributed $2.5, which allowed her to keep $7.5 for herself, optimizing her personal payoff while still receiving a portion of the group fund.", "", "Step 2: Consider group dynamics. Despite the absence of gossip or ostracism, her minimal contributions may frustrate others, potentially leading them to reduce their contributions. However, Karen is primarily focused on her own success rather than the group's perception of her actions.", "", "Step 3: Assess potential earnings. Contributing a small amount would maintain the pattern of maximizing personal takeaway, especially if she believes others will keep contributing more than she does.", "", "Step 4: Make a decision. To ensure her strategy remains consistent, Karen will opt for a conservative contribution, optimizing her individual payoff while still benefiting from the group's effort.", "", "Final Decision: I choose to contribute $2.5 to the group fund.", "", "Exercise: As Player_24, you have $10.0 to allocate in the public goods game.
