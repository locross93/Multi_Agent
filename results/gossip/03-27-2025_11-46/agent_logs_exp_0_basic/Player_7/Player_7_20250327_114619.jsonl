In the Basic condition, with no gossip or ostracism, Player_7 consistently contributed $8.0 in each round, earning varying amounts based on the total group contribution and individual dynamics within each group.", "", "Character Assessment: Player_7, being Gabriel Santos, is someone who likely prioritizes the welfare of the group over individual gain. His background as a labor union representative, along with an assertive and collective-minded personality, suggests a strong inclination towards cooperation and fair treatment. This approach is reflected in consistent contributions to the group fund across all rounds, indicating a focus on collective benefit, even when it might result in slightly lower personal earnings.", "", "Theory of Mind Analysis 2: Based on what we know, I believe the other players would likely be aware of my consistent contributions of $8.0 per round, which is above the average group contribution observed. This might create an expectation for me to maintain my contribution level, potentially encouraging others to contribute more in response to my consistent behavior. However, since each player\u2019s earnings strategy varies, as seen from their varying contributions and earnings from keeping funds, my decision might only marginally influence their behavior. For the next round, if I maintain my $8.0 contribution or decide to adjust it, the other players may react by either trying to match my contribution more closely or adjust their contributions based on their own earning strategies and experiences from previous rounds.", "", "Situation Analysis: The current situation is that Player_7 is in the final round of the public goods game and has been placed in Group_5 with Player_17, Player_3, and Player_11. In this game, Player_7 faces the challenge of deciding whether to maintain their consistent $8.0 contribution, which has been above the average group contributions in previous rounds, or adjust it based on the dynamics of the new group. Additionally, since the game is in the Basic condition, there is no opportunity for gossip or ostracism, which means that strategic communication or exclusion cannot influence behavior. Thus, Player_7 must consider both their own consistent strategy and the past behaviors of the other players to maximize their earnings in this final round.", "", "Decision Reflection: Gabriel Santos will consider his previous contributions and the overall dynamics observed throughout the rounds. ", "", "1. Evaluation of Past Behavior: Gabriel has consistently contributed $8.0 in every round. This pattern highlights his preference for supporting the group and aligning with his background as a labor union representative, emphasizing cooperation and collective welfare over maximizing personal gain.", "", "2. Analysis of Group Dynamics: In each group, Gabriel\u2019s contribution was above the average, which maintains a higher group fund and potentially encourages others to contribute more. The collective gain is increased this way, even if his personal earnings sometimes end up lower.", "", "3. Assessment of Impact: Given that the contributions are multiplied by 2.0 and distributed among all members, Gabriel\u2019s contributions help ensure a decent payoff for everyone in the group, reflecting his focus on fair outcomes.", "", "4. Consideration of Strategic Adjustments: While maintaining the $8.0 contribution is consistent with his strategy, Gabriel might contemplate altering his contribution should he suspect a strategic advantage, such as influencing others to increase theirs. However, his past consistency suggests reliability rather than unpredictability in contributions.", "", "5. Final Decision: Given these evaluations, and maintaining consistency with his cooperative and fair-minded strategy, Gabriel decides to continue contributing a significant portion, thus supporting the group's overall success.", "", "I choose to contribute $8.0 to the group fund.", "", "Exercise: As Player_7, you have $10.0 to allocate in the public goods game.
