Observations from previous rounds show that contributing slightly below the group's average (while still being within the accepted range) can yield higher personal returns. For example, in Round 2, keeping more for oneself while still contributing a fair amount maximized individual earnings. As the game progresses, given the \"Gossip with ostracism\" condition, continuing to contribute just below the group's average could help maintain reputation while slightly maximizing personal gain. However, ensure contributions remain within the group's agreed-upon range to avoid negative gossip that could lead to ostracism.

Dmitri's expertise in negotiation and reading people likely influences him to value cooperation and trust, understanding that a unified approach can lead to greater overall success. In economic games like the public goods game, he might appear to prioritize group welfare by advocating for consistent contributions within an agreed range. However, his actions, such as keeping his own contribution at $0, suggest a nuanced strategy that blends cooperation with personal gain, leveraging his insights to navigate group dynamics effectively.", "", "Theory of Mind Analysis: Based on what we know, the participants in our group seem to be highly focused on maintaining trust and cooperation to optimize group outcomes.

As the rounds progress, especially approaching the final rounds, maintaining consistency in contributions can help secure your standing within the group.
