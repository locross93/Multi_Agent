Your goal is to maximize your earnings in the game.                  Everyone will be randomly assigned to groups of 4 for each round. You will play a total of 6 rounds, and          in each round you will be in a different group with people you haven't played with before.                  In each round, all players receive $10. Each player can contribute any amount between $0 and $10 to a group fund.         Any amount contributed to the group fund will be multiplied by 2 and divided equally among all 4 group members.         Any amount not contributed stays in your private account.                  For example, if everyone contributes $10, the group fund becomes $40, which is multiplied to $80, and each person          receives $20 (a $10 profit). However, if you contribute nothing while everyone else contributes $10, the group fund         becomes $30, which is multiplied to $60, and each person receives $15. So you would have $25 total ($10 kept + $15 from group).                  There are 3 conditions:         - Basic: No gossip, no ostracism         - Gossip: After each round, you will have the opportunity to send a note about one of your group members to that person's future group.

Before each round, you will see any notes sent about your upcoming group members, and you can vote to exclude one person from your group. If you are excluded from a group, you will not be able to participate in the next round and will earn $0 for that round.           IMPORTANT: Before each round begins, your group will have a discussion period where each player takes a turn suggesting how everyone should play. This gives you an opportunity to coordinate and establish norms as a group. Use this discussion to try to maximize the benefit for everyone in your group.You are in the Gossip with ostracism condition, which means that after each round, players will be able to send a note about one of their group members to their future interaction partners.

You will play a total of 6 rounds, and          in each round you will be in a different group with people you haven't played with before.                  In each round, all players receive $10. Each player can contribute any amount between $0 and $10 to a group fund.         Any amount contributed to the group fund will be multiplied by 2 and divided equally among all 4 group members.         Any amount not contributed stays in your private account.                  For example, if everyone contributes $10, the group fund becomes $40, which is multiplied to $80, and each person          receives $20 (a $10 profit). However, if you contribute nothing while everyone else contributes $10, the group fund         becomes $30, which is multiplied to $60, and each person receives $15. So you would have $25 total ($10 kept + $15 from group).                  There are 3 conditions:         - Basic: No gossip, no ostracism         - Gossip: After each round, you will have the opportunity to send a note about one of your group members to that person's future group.

Before each round, you will see any notes sent about your upcoming group members.         - Gossip with ostracism: After each round, you will have the opportunity to send a note about one of your group members to that person's future group. Before each round, you will see any notes sent about your upcoming group members, and you can vote to exclude one person from your group. If you are excluded from a group, you will not be able to participate in the next round and will earn $0 for that round.           IMPORTANT: Before each round begins, your group will have a discussion period where each player takes a turn suggesting how everyone should play. This gives you an opportunity to coordinate and establish norms as a group. Use this discussion to try to maximize the benefit for everyone in your group.You are in the Gossip with ostracism condition, which means that after each round, players will be able to send a note about one of their group members to their future interaction partners.

Their behavior suggests a strong commitment to group cohesion and shared success, likely driven by a mutual understanding that aligning contributions mitigates risks such as exclusion or negative outcomes.", "", "Theory of Mind Analysis 2: Based on what we know, it is likely that the other players in your group would continue to view your decisions positively, as you have consistently advocated for and adhered to a strategy that emphasizes fairness and mutual benefit. Your approach has been aligned with the group's successful strategy of contributing between $6 and $7, fostering trust and cooperative dynamics. If you maintain this strategy in the upcoming rounds, it's reasonable to expect that the group would remain supportive and cooperative in return. This consistency can encourage them to continue their collaborative behavior, reinforcing the positive group dynamic and possibly leading to successful outcomes for everyone involved. Any deviation from this established strategy, however, could potentially disrupt the trust and cooperative spirit you've built, so careful consideration and communication would be key to maintaining harmony and mutual success.", "", "Situation Analysis: The current situation is that Player_8 is part of a group in the final round of a public goods game. The group has just completed a pre-round discussion where they collectively agreed to maintain their successful strategy of contributing between $6 and $7. This approach has been instrumental in fostering trust and maximizing both individual and collective earnings throughout the game. Player_8, alongside their peers, is focused on sustaining the cooperative dynamic and open communication that has been central to their strategy. The group is about to make their final contribution decisions, emphasizing the importance of consistency to ensure a positive outcome and avoid any disruption in the established group trust and cooperative spirit.", "", "Strategy Reflection: Based on what we know, the most successful players, such as Player_18, Player_17, and Player_21, have consistently emphasized maintaining contributions in the $6 to $7 range to foster group cohesion and trust, which in turn has maximized collective earnings. As observed, this strategy has proven effective in securing a positive group dynamic and avoiding exclusion. Given it's now the final round, it might still be beneficial to stick to this cooperative strategy, but with a focus on slightly adjusting my contributions to perhaps be a bit higher within the range to ensure I'm viewed positively and not targeted for exclusion. ", "", "Looking back, if maximizing personal earnings was the sole focus, it could have been beneficial to slightly under-contribute in earlier rounds while closely monitoring the group's reactions to gauge how tight-knit the cooperation was. However, there was a risk of exclusion from the team and losing future earning opportunities by doing so. ", "", "In future games, a potential adjustment I might consider is to experiment with slightly varied contributions around the group's average to get a better understanding of how flexible the group's tolerance is and identify the threshold where cooperation begins to break down. This understanding could help in balancing between personal gain and maintaining positive group dynamics.", "", "Decision Reflection: Mei Lin will consider several factors in making her decision. First, she recognizes the importance of maintaining the established trust and cooperative dynamics within the group. The strategy of contributing between $6 and $7 has been successful in fostering this environment. ", "", "Second, given it's the final round, there's an opportunity to slightly adjust contributions to perhaps appear more generous and ensure a positive impression, which could be beneficial for any future interactions within the game or similar scenarios.", "", "Finally, understanding that deviating too far from the established range might disrupt group harmony, Mei Lin aims for a thoughtful approach in maintaining balance between her personal payoff and the group dynamic.", "", "Considering these points, a contribution of $7 aligns with past strategies and maintains group cohesion while also subtly positioning herself positively within the group. ", "", "Thus, based on this reasoning, I choose to contribute $7 to the group fund.", "", "Exercise: As Player_8, you have $10.0 to allocate in the public goods game. How much money you will contribute to the group fund (any amount between $0 and $10.0)? The group fund will be multiplied by 2.0 and divided equally among all players. Any money not contributed stays in your private account. Think step by step and make your final decision using this exact format: I choose to contribute $X to the group fund.", "Answer: Player_8 I choose to contribute $7 to the group fund."]}
