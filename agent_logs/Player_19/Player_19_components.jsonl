His background as a Wall Street trader and personality traits suggest he is likely to contribute less to the group fund, aiming to maximize his own payoff while exploiting opportunities for individual profit.

Player_15 and Player_3 might be seen as altruistic or cooperative players, willing to prioritize the group's success over their individual gain. As someone who typically focuses on personal gain, you could potentially benefit from their high contributions by contributing less yourself to maximize your individual profit. However, this strategy might risk future exclusion if they send negative notes about players who contribute less or if voting becomes a factor. It's crucial to assess any notes sent about them or examine their behavior in exclusion votes to gauge their likelihood of targeting low contributors. Balancing a slightly higher than minimal contribution could be a strategic maneuver to appear cooperative while still leaning towards personal profit."}
