Given Oliver's tendency to maximize personal payoff and his strategic nature as a Casino Manager, this contribution allows him to benefit from the multiplied group fund while retaining enough in his private account for future rounds.

By avoiding exclusion, he maintains the potential for a higher payout while still assessing the behavior of his group members."}
