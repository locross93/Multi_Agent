This suggests they value group success but also keep a slight reserve for personal security. Player_19 and Player_2's contributions and behaviors haven't been recorded yet, so it's harder to gauge their tendencies. However, the fact that Player_15 contributed generously might indicate a group dynamic leaning towards cooperation. As for the voting and note-sending aspects, if players are seeing notes about one another and making exclusion decisions, those actions will likely be informed by both the contribution levels and conveyed reputations. Therefore, low contributors might risk exclusion if observed by those prioritizing group success, while anyone sending or receiving negative gossip could also face being voted out. Overall, players who consistently contribute high amounts and foster positive communication would likely earn trust and consistent inclusion in future rounds."}
