Methods: Trust Game with Third-Party Punishment using Generative Agents

We implemented a Trust Game with Third-Party Punishment (TPP) using generative agents powered by large language models. The experiment was designed to test how public versus private punishment decisions affect subsequent trust and reciprocity.

Experimental Design
The TPP game consisted of two stages with four players. In Stage 1, a Helper could send any portion of $10 to a Recipient, with the sent amount being tripled. After observing this interaction, a Punisher could spend $2 to reduce the Helper's payoff by $6. In Stage 2, the Punisher became the Recipient in a new trust game with the previous observer (now Helper) who had witnessed the punishment decision. We manipulated whether the punishment decision was public or private to the new Helper.

Generative Agent Implementation
Each agent was implemented as an autonomous entity with:
1. A distinct persona randomly selected from a pool of 50 diverse characters with varying cooperation tendencies (0.1-0.9)
2. An associative memory system that stored and retrieved relevant past experiences
3. Action generation capabilities through a large language model
4. The ability to observe and react to other agents' decisions

The agents were initialized with:
- A unique identity (name, age, occupation, background)
- Personality traits that influenced their decision-making
- A cooperation tendency score
- The full scenario description
- Role-specific goals (e.g., "You are player 3")

Agent Decision-Making
Agents made decisions by:
1. Accessing their recent memories of the game
2. Considering their persona's traits and cooperation tendency
3. Generating actions through natural language responses to specific prompts
4. Having their responses parsed to extract numerical decisions

Experimental Conditions
We ran two conditions:
1. Public: The Stage 1 Helper's punishment status was known to the Stage 2 Helper
2. Private: The Stage 1 Helper's punishment status was not revealed

Data Collection
For each experimental run, we recorded:
- Punishment decisions in Stage 1
- Amount sent by Helper in Stage 2
- Amount returned by Recipient in Stage 2
- The personas of both agents
- All agent observations and decisions
- Whether the condition was public or private

This implementation allowed us to study how knowledge of past punishment decisions affects subsequent trust and reciprocity in a controlled setting with autonomous agents exhibiting consistent but diverse personalities.
